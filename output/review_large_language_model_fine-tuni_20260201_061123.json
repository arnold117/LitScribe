        "abstract": "Instruction tuning significantly enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, the procedure to optimizing the mixing of instruction datasets for LLM fine-tuning is still poorly understood. This study categorizes instructions into three primary types: NLP downstream tasks, coding, and general chat. We explore the effects of instruction tuning on different combinations of datasets on LLM performance, and find that certain instruction types are more advantageous for specific applications but can negatively impact other areas. This work provides insights into instruction mixtures, laying the foundations for future research.",

        "abstract": "We give simpler, sparser, and faster algorithms for differentially private fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained language models, which achieve the state-of-the-art privacy versus utility tradeoffs on many standard NLP tasks. We propose a meta-framework for this problem, inspired by the recent success of highly parameter-efficient methods for fine-tuning. Our experiments show that differentially private adaptations of these approaches outperform previous private algorithms in three important dimensions: utility, privacy, and the computational and memory cost of private training. On many commonly studied datasets, the utility of private models approaches that of non-private models. For example, on the MNLI dataset we achieve an accuracy of $87.8\\%$ using RoBERTa-Large and $83.5\\%$ using RoBERTa-Base with a privacy budget of $ε= 6.7$. In comparison, absent privacy constraints, RoBERTa-Large achieves an accuracy of $90.2\\%$. Our findings are similar for natural language generation tasks. Privately fine-tuning with DART, GPT-2-Small, GPT-2-Medium, GPT-2-Large, and GPT-2-XL achieve BLEU scores of 38.5, 42.0, 43.1, and 43.8 respectively (privacy budget of $ε= 6.8,δ=$ 1e-5) whereas the non-private baseline is $48.1$. All our experiments suggest that larger models are better suited for private fine-tuning: while they are well known to achieve superior accuracy non-privately, we find that they also better maintain their accuracy when privacy is introduced.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved success in acting as agents, which interact with environments through tools such as search engines. However, LLMs are optimized for language generation instead of tool use during training or alignment, limiting their effectiveness as agents. To resolve this problem, previous work has first collected interaction trajectories between LLMs and environments, using only trajectories that successfully finished the task to fine-tune smaller models, making fine-tuning data scarce and acquiring it both difficult and costly. Discarding failed trajectories also leads to significant wastage of data and resources and limits the possible optimization paths during fine-tuning. In this paper, we argue that unsuccessful trajectories offer valuable insights, and LLMs can learn from these trajectories through appropriate quality control and fine-tuning strategies. By simply adding a prefix or suffix that tells the model whether to generate a successful trajectory during training, we improve model performance by a large margin on mathematical reasoning, multi-hop question answering, and strategic question answering tasks. We further analyze the inference results and find that our method provides a better trade-off between valuable information and errors in unsuccessful trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the value of negative trajectories and their application in agent-tunning scenarios. Our findings offer guidance for developing better agent-tuning methods and low-resource data usage techniques.",

        "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) with open-domain instruction following data brings colossal success. However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Human evaluations on a complexity-balanced test bed and Vicuna's testset show that instructions from Evol-Instruct are superior to human-created ones. By analyzing the human evaluation results of the high complexity part, we demonstrate that outputs from our WizardLM are preferred to outputs from OpenAI ChatGPT. In GPT-4 automatic evaluation, WizardLM achieves more than 90\\% capacity of ChatGPT on 17 out of 29 skills. Even though WizardLM still lags behind ChatGPT in some aspects, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with AI-evolved instructions is a promising direction for enhancing LLMs. Our code and data are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM",

        "abstract": "It is impossible today to pretend that the practice of machine learning is always compatible with the idea that training and testing data follow the same distribution. Several authors have recently used ensemble techniques to show how scenarios involving multiple data distributions are best served by representations that are both richer than those obtained by regularizing for the best in-distribution performance, and richer than those obtained under the influence of the implicit sparsity bias of common stochastic gradient procedures.\n  This contribution investigates the use of very high dropout rates instead of ensembles to obtain such rich representations. Although training a deep network from scratch using such dropout rates is virtually impossible, fine-tuning a large pre-trained model under such conditions is not only possible but also achieves out-of-distribution performances that exceed those of both ensembles and weight averaging methods such as model soups.\n  This result has practical significance because the importance of the fine-tuning scenario has considerably grown in recent years. This result also provides interesting insights on the nature of rich representations and on the intrinsically linear nature of fine-tuning a large network using a comparatively small dataset.",

However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic, non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM) using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios.

        "abstract": "The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since large language models (LLMs) first appeared. Yet, their massive memory consumption has become a significant roadblock to large-scale training. For instance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full parameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to high-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not reach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freezes most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over 10%-35% in terms of MT-Bench score while achieving on-par or better performance in MMLU, AGIEval and WinoGrande. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA surpasses LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.",

A large gap exists between LLMs' pass-at-one and pass-at-N performance in solving math problems, suggesting LLMs might be close to finding correct solutions, motivating our exploration of fine-tuning methods to unlock LLMs' performance. Using the challenging MATH dataset, we investigate three fine-tuning strategies: (1) solution fine-tuning, where we fine-tune to generate a detailed solution for a given math problem; (2) solution-cluster re-ranking, where the LLM is fine-tuned as a solution verifier/evaluator to choose among generated candidate solution clusters; (3) multi-task sequential fine-tuning, which integrates both solution generation and evaluation tasks together efficiently to enhance the LLM performance. With these methods, we present a thorough empirical study on a series of PaLM 2 models and find: (1) The quality and style of the step-by-step solutions used for fine-tuning can make a significant impact on the model performance; (2) While solution re-ranking and majority voting are both effective for improving the model performance when used separately, they can also be used together for an even greater performance boost; (3) Multi-task fine-tuning that sequentially separates the solution generation and evaluation tasks can offer improved performance compared with the solution fine-tuning baseline. Guided by these insights, we design a fine-tuning recipe that yields approximately 58.8% accuracy on the MATH dataset with fine-tuned PaLM 2-L models, an 11.2% accuracy improvement over the few-shot performance of pre-trained PaLM 2-L model with majority voting.",

Fine-tuning MLLM has become a common practice to improve performance on specific downstream tasks. However, during fine-tuning, MLLM often faces the risk of forgetting knowledge acquired during pre-training, which can result in a decline in generalization abilities. To balance the trade-off between generalization and specialization, we propose measuring the parameter importance for both pre-trained and fine-tuning distributions, based on frozen pre-trained weight magnitude and accumulated fine-tuning gradient values. We further apply an importance-aware weight allocation strategy, selectively updating relatively important parameters for downstream tasks. We conduct empirical evaluations on both image captioning and visual question-answering tasks using various MLLM architectures. The comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solution, highlighting the efficiency of the crucial modules in enhancing downstream specialization performance while mitigating generalization degradation in MLLM Fine-Tuning.",

Despite the success, fine-tuning continues to rely on repeated and lengthy prompts, which escalate computational expenses, require more resources, and lead to slower inference. In this paper, we present a novel approach, PromptIntern, which internalizes prompt knowledge during model fine-tuning to achieve efficient inference and save costs. Instead of compressing the prompts for a vanilla model, PromptIntern aims to embed the recurrent prompt directly into the model parameters. We design a fine-tuning pipeline that includes instruction template compression, few-shot example absorption, and a progressive internalization strategy, effectively diminishing the need for intricate prompts during inference. Comprehensive experiments on challenging NL2Code tasks demonstrate that our method reduces input tokens by more than 90%, accelerates inference by 4.2 times, and reduces monetary inference costs by 88.3%.",

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on downstream tasks has become the de-facto learning paradigm in NLP. However, conventional approaches fine-tune all the parameters of the pre-trained model, which becomes prohibitive as the model size and the number of tasks grow. Recent work has proposed a variety of parameter-efficient transfer learning methods that only fine-tune a small number of (extra) parameters to attain strong performance. While effective, the critical ingredients for success and the connections among the various methods are poorly understood. In this paper, we break down the design of state-of-the-art parameter-efficient transfer learning methods and present a unified framework that establishes connections between them. Specifically, we re-frame them as modifications to specific hidden states in pre-trained models, and define a set of design dimensions along which different methods vary, such as the function to compute the modification and the position to apply the modification. Through comprehensive empirical studies across machine translation, text summarization, language understanding, and text classification benchmarks, we utilize the unified view to identify important design choices in previous methods. Furthermore, our unified framework enables the transfer of design elements across different approaches, and as a result we are able to instantiate new parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that tune less parameters than previous methods while being more effective, achieving comparable results to fine-tuning all parameters on all four tasks.",

To minimize the adaption cost for downstream tasks, many Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques are proposed for language and 2D image pre-trained models. However, the specialized PEFT method for 3D pre-trained models is still under-explored. To this end, we introduce Point-PEFT, a novel framework for adapting point cloud pre-trained models with minimal learnable parameters. Specifically, for a pre-trained 3D model, we freeze most of its parameters, and only tune the newly added PEFT modules on downstream tasks, which consist of a Point-prior Prompt and a Geometry-aware Adapter. The Point-prior Prompt adopts a set of learnable prompt tokens, for which we propose to construct a memory bank with domain-specific knowledge, and utilize a parameter-free attention to enhance the prompt tokens. The Geometry-aware Adapter aims to aggregate point cloud features within spatial neighborhoods to capture fine-grained geometric information through local interactions. Extensive experiments indicate that our Point-PEFT can achieve better performance than the full fine-tuning on various downstream tasks, while using only 5% of the trainable parameters, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

However, the scaling up of large foundation models has led to soaring costs in fine-tuning and parameter storage, rendering extensive adaptations impractical. This challenge has sparked the development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on optimizing a select subset of parameters while keeping the rest fixed, significantly lowering computational and storage overheads. While recent years have witnessed a significant success in PEFT, a deep understanding of the fundamental principles behind these methods remains unexplored. To this end, here we take the first step to unify all approaches by dissecting them from a decomposition perspective. We initiate a comprehensive mathematical analysis of these methods, allowing us to delve deeply into their underlying mechanisms, and we explore the reasons behind the variations in performance among different techniques. Furthermore, inspired by our theoretical analysis, we introduce two novel PEFT methods alongside a simple yet effective framework designed to enhance the performance of PEFT techniques across various applications. Our empirical validations, conducted across multiple datasets, demonstrate the efficacy of these methods, showcasing both theoretical validity and practical performance improvements under the guidance of our analytical findings. We believe our work will deepen researchers' understanding of PEFT and other techniques, prompting further contemplation and advancing the research across the whole community.",

A common practice for this task is to train a model on the base set first and then transfer to novel classes through fine-tuning (Here fine-tuning procedure is defined as transferring knowledge from base to novel data, i.e. learning to transfer in few-shot scenario.) or meta-learning. However, as the base classes have no overlap to the novel set, simply transferring whole knowledge from base data is not an optimal solution since some knowledge in the base model may be biased or even harmful to the novel class. In this paper, we propose to transfer partial knowledge by freezing or fine-tuning particular layer(s) in the base model. Specifically, layers will be imposed different learning rates if they are chosen to be fine-tuned, to control the extent of preserved transferability. To determine which layers to be recast and what values of learning rates for them, we introduce an evolutionary search based method that is efficient to simultaneously locate the target layers and determine their individual learning rates. We conduct extensive experiments on CUB and mini-ImageNet to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both meta-learning and non-meta based frameworks. Furthermore, we extend our method to the conventional pre-training + fine-tuning paradigm and obtain consistent improvement.",

        "abstract": "Recently, instruction-following Large Language Models (LLMs) , represented by ChatGPT, have exhibited exceptional performance in general Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, the unique characteristics of E-commerce data pose significant challenges to general LLMs. An LLM tailored specifically for E-commerce scenarios, possessing robust cross-dataset/task generalization capabilities, is a pressing necessity. To solve this issue, in this work, we proposed the first E-commerce instruction dataset EcomInstruct, with a total of 2.5 million instruction data. EcomInstruct scales up the data size and task diversity by constructing atomic tasks with E-commerce basic data types, such as product information, user reviews. Atomic tasks are defined as intermediate tasks implicitly involved in solving a final task, which we also call Chain-of-Task tasks. We developed EcomGPT\nwith different parameter scales by training the backbone model BLOOMZ with the EcomInstruct. Benefiting from the fundamental semantic understanding capabilities acquired from the Chain-of-Task tasks, EcomGPT exhibits excellent zero-shot generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that EcomGPT outperforms ChatGPT in term of cross-dataset/task generalization on E-commerce tasks. The EcomGPT will be public at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/EcomGPT.",

        "abstract": "Despite vision-language models' (VLMs) remarkable capabilities as versatile visual assistants, two substantial challenges persist within the existing VLM frameworks: (1) lacking task diversity in pretraining and visual instruction tuning, and (2) annotation error and bias in GPT-4 synthesized instruction tuning data. Both challenges lead to issues such as poor generalizability, hallucination, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we construct Vision-Flan, the most diverse publicly available visual instruction tuning dataset to date, comprising 187 diverse tasks and 1,664,261 instances sourced from academic datasets, and each task is accompanied by an expert-written instruction. In addition, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning framework, in which VLMs are firstly finetuned on Vision-Flan and further tuned on GPT-4 synthesized data. We find this two-stage tuning framework significantly outperforms the traditional single-stage visual instruction tuning framework and achieves the state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of multi-modal evaluation benchmarks. Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to understand visual instruction tuning and our findings reveal that: (1) GPT-4 synthesized data does not substantially enhance VLMs' capabilities but rather modulates the model's responses to human-preferred formats; (2) A minimal quantity (e.g., 1,000) of GPT-4 synthesized data can effectively align VLM responses with human-preference; (3) Visual instruction tuning mainly helps large-language models (LLMs) to understand visual features.",

Despite its relevance and practical usefulness, automatic code editing remains an underexplored area in the evolution of deep learning models, partly due to data scarcity. In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to edit code based on user instructions. Evaluated on a novel human-written execution-based benchmark dubbed EditEval, we found current models often struggle to fulfill the instructions. In light of this, we contribute InstructCoder, the first instruction-tuning dataset designed to adapt LLMs for general-purpose code editing, containing high-diversity code-editing tasks such as comment insertion, code optimization, and code refactoring. It consists of over 114,000 instruction-input-output triplets and covers multiple distinct code editing scenarios. The collection process starts with filtered commit data sourced from GitHub Python repositories as seeds. Subsequently, the dataset is systematically expanded through an iterative process, where both seed and generated tasks are used to prompt ChatGPT for more data. Our findings reveal that open-source LLMs fine-tuned on InstructCoder can significantly enhance the accuracy of code edits, exhibiting superior code-editing performance matching advanced proprietary LLMs. The datasets and the source code are publicly available at https://github.com/qishenghu/CodeInstruct.",

Therefore, this paper makes an in-depth empirical study of instruction-tuning LLMs in Chinese, which can serve as a cookbook that provides valuable findings for effectively customizing LLMs that can better respond to Chinese instructions. Specifically, we systematically explore the impact of LLM bases, parameter-efficient methods, instruction data types, which are the three most important elements for instruction-tuning. Besides, we also conduct experiment to study the impact of other factors, e.g., chain-of-thought data and human-value alignment. We hope that this empirical study can make a modest contribution to the open Chinese version of ChatGPT. This paper will release a powerful Chinese LLMs that is comparable to ChatGLM.

This dataset covers various topics and is suitable for instruction-tuning general-purpose LLMs for diverse clinical use cases. Additionally, we propose Llemr , a general framework that enables LLMs to process and interpret EHRs with complex data structures. Llemr demonstrates competitive performance in answering a wide range of patient-related questions based on EHR data. Furthermore, our evaluations on clinical predictive modeling benchmarks reveal that the fine-tuned Llemr achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines using curated features.

      "methodology": "This study employs a systematic experimental design to investigate the effects of mixing instruction types during the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). The core approach is a combinatorial ablation study, where models are fine-tuned on all eight possible combinations of three distinct, representative instruction datasets. Each dataset is selected to epitomize a primary instruction category: **P3** (Public Pool of Prompts) for NLP downstream tasks, **CodeAlpaca** for code generation, and **Alpaca** for general-purpose chat instructions. By training separate models on each mixture—ranging from single-domain sets (e.g., only CodeAlpaca) to the full combination of all three—the researchers isolate and compare the impact of each instruction type and their interactions on final model capabilities. The base model for all experiments is **LLaMA-7B**, which is fine-tuned using a standard supervised fine-tuning procedure with a cross-entropy loss objective, allowing for controlled comparisons across the different data mixtures.\n\nData collection and categorization are central to the methodological framework. The three source datasets are not merely used as provided but are analytically characterized to validate their intended instructional focus. For P3 and CodeAlpaca, this involves reporting their inherent task distributions. For the more heterogeneous Alpaca dataset, the authors apply a **dependency parsing** technique to extract the root verb from each instruction, identifying over 1,000 unique verbs (e.g., *generate*, *create*, *describe*) to demonstrate its broad, chat-oriented nature. This analytical step substantiates the classification of the datasets into the three predefined types. The evaluation phase then utilizes separate benchmark suites aligned with each capability domain: **NLP downstream tasks** (measured via the **EleutherAI LM Evaluation Harness** on benchmarks like BoolQ and HellaSwag), **coding proficiency** (assessed using **HumanEval** for pass@1 code generation), and **chat capabilities** (evaluated by **GPT-4 pairwise comparisons** against a baseline model across diverse prompts).\n\nThe analysis techniques are primarily quantitative and comparative, focusing on the performance trajectories and trade-offs induced by different instruction mixtures. Key configurations include fine-tuning for **3 epochs** with a consistent experimental setup (e.g., learning rate, batch size) across all conditions to ensure comparability. The core analysis involves plotting and comparing performance metrics across the three evaluation domains for each of the eight fine-tuned models. This allows the researchers to identify patterns such as positive transfer (where training on one instruction type improves performance in another domain), negative interference (where performance in one area degrades due to training on a different instruction type), and saturation effects. The use of **GPT-4 for pairwise evaluation** of chat quality introduces a state-of-the-art, model-based assessment technique to complement traditional accuracy-based benchmarks. Ultimately, the methodology enables a granular dissection of how the composition of the instruction tuning dataset shapes the multi-faceted capabilities of the resulting LLM.",

However, LLMs are optimized for language generation instead of tool use during training or alignment, limiting their effectiveness as agents. To resolve this problem, previous work has first collected interaction trajectories between LLMs and environments, using only trajectories that successfully finished the task to fine-tune smaller models, making fine-tuning data scarce and acquiring it both difficult and costly. Discarding failed trajectories also leads to significant wastage of data and resources and limits the possible optimization paths during fine-tuning. In this paper, we argue that unsuccessful trajectories offer valuable insights, and LLMs can learn from these trajectories through appropriate quality control and fine-tuning strategies.

The core research design challenges the prevailing paradigm in agent-tuning, which exclusively utilizes successful interaction trajectories (positive examples) for fine-tuning smaller models. The authors propose that unsuccessful trajectories (negative examples) contain valuable, learnable signals. Their approach involves a simple yet strategic modification to the fine-tuning data: appending a prefix or suffix to each trajectory that explicitly labels it as either a successful or unsuccessful example. This design allows the model to learn not only the correct patterns from positive trajectories but also to recognize and avoid erroneous reasoning and action sequences from negative ones, thereby making more efficient use of collected interaction data and providing a richer optimization landscape.\n\nFor data collection, the methodology follows a common agent-tuning pipeline but expands its utility. The researchers use a powerful, closed-source LLM (e.g., GPT-4) as a \"teacher\" to interact with task-specific environments, generating trajectories that include the model's actions (e.g., tool calls) and environmental observations. Crucially, they collect both trajectories that successfully complete the task and those that fail. This contrasts with prior work that discards the failed trajectories. The fine-tuning is then applied to smaller, open-source models using this combined dataset of positive and negative examples. The evaluation employs benchmarks across multiple domains to assess generalizability, specifically mentioning mathematical reasoning, multi-hop question answering, and strategic question answering tasks, though specific dataset names (e.g., GSM8K, HotpotQA) are implied rather than listed in the provided excerpt.\n\nThe analysis techniques are centered on comparative performance evaluation and qualitative inspection. The primary metric is the improvement in task success rate of the fine-tuned models compared to baselines trained only on positive examples. The key parameter or configuration under investigation is the method of integrating negative examples—namely, the use of a conditioning prefix or suffix (e.g., \"Successful trajectory:\" or \"Unsuccessful trajectory:\") prepended or appended to the trajectory data during training. This conditioning token acts as a control mechanism, guiding the model on whether to generate a successful sequence. The analysis further involves examining inference results to determine how the method balances the extraction of valuable information from negative trajectories against the risk of learning from their errors, aiming to demonstrate a superior trade-off that leads to more robust agent performance.",

      "methodology": "**Study Design and Approach**\n\nThe core methodological innovation of WizardLM is the **Evol-Instruct** framework, a synthetic data generation approach designed to automatically enhance the complexity of instruction-following datasets. The study employs a **two-stage pipeline**: first, an initial seed of human-written instructions is programmatically evolved into more complex variants using a large language model (LLM) as the evolutionary engine; second, the resulting mixture of original and evolved instructions is used to fine-tune a base pre-trained model, specifically **LLaMA**. This approach is positioned as a solution to the limitations of manual annotation, which is costly and tends to produce instructions skewed toward lower complexity. The experimental design is comparative, evaluating the resulting **WizardLM** against contemporary instruction-tuned baselines, namely **Alpaca** (trained on Self-Instruct data) and **Vicuna** (trained on human-user conversations from ShareGPT), to demonstrate the efficacy of complexity-driven data synthesis.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\n\nThe process begins with an initial seed dataset of instructions. While not explicitly named in the provided excerpt, the context suggests the use of a common open-source collection, such as the **Alpaca dataset** from Self-Instruct, which itself is generated from a seed of 175 human-written instructions. The Evol-Instruct method then applies a suite of **evolutionary operations**—such as deepening, concretizing, increasing reasoning steps, adding constraints, or complicating input—to these seed instructions. A controlling LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) is prompted to execute these operations, rewriting each instruction step-by-step into progressively more complex versions. This yields a final, mixed-complexity training corpus comprising the original and evolved instruction-output pairs. The methodology critically leverages **ShareGPT** (a dataset of human-ChatGPT conversations) as a benchmark for analyzing the natural distribution of instruction difficulty, noting its skew toward easy or moderate tasks, which Evol-Instruct aims to rectify.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\n\nEvaluation employs both **automatic metrics** and **human assessment** to gauge model performance. The automatic evaluation likely involves benchmarking on established instruction-following or reasoning test suites (common in related work), though specific metrics are not detailed in the excerpt. The human evaluation is emphasized as a consistent and reliable measure, presumably involving pairwise comparisons between model outputs for quality, correctness, and complexity adherence. A key analytical component is the **difficulty-level analysis** of the generated data, illustrated in Figure 5a, which compares the complexity distribution of Evol-Instruct outputs against that of human-created ShareGPT data. This validates the framework’s success in generating a higher proportion of complex instructions. The primary configuration parameters involve the **evolutionary operations** defined within Evol-Instruct and the **fine-tuning protocol** applied to the LLaMA base model using the synthesized dataset, with the central claim being that the quality and complexity gradient of the training data directly and significantly enhance the model's ability to follow intricate instructions.",

The core design involves fine-tuning large, pre-trained vision models (specifically CLIP ViT-B/32 and ViT-L/14) on a primary dataset (ImageNet-1k) while applying dropout rates dramatically higher than conventional practice—ranging from 0.5 to an extreme of 0.99—to the final embedding layer before the classification head. This approach is predicated on the hypothesis that such aggressive regularization prevents over-specialization to the fine-tuning distribution by forcing the model to utilize a broader, more redundant set of features from the pre-trained backbone. The performance of these high-dropout fine-tuned models is then systematically benchmarked against strong baselines, including standard fine-tuning, model soups (weight averaging), and deep ensembles, across a suite of OOD test datasets.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\n\nThe study utilizes established public datasets to ensure reproducibility and comparison with prior work. For the primary fine-tuning task, the authors use **ImageNet-1k**. OOD generalization is evaluated using a carefully curated collection of **10 distribution shift datasets**, including ImageNet-V2, ImageNet-Sketch, ImageNet-A, ImageNet-R, and ObjectNet, among others. This multi-dataset benchmark allows the authors to measure robustness across various types of distributional changes, such as stylistic shifts, adversarial examples, and natural variations. The use of pre-trained **CLIP models** is also a critical methodological component, as their robust, semantically rich visual representations provide a foundational starting point that makes fine-tuning with extreme dropout feasible, whereas training from scratch under such conditions would be intractable.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\n\nThe primary analysis technique is comparative performance evaluation using **average accuracy** across the suite of OOD datasets as the key metric. The authors also analyze the learned representations by examining the **effective dimensionality** and **feature diversity** of the embedding space, using metrics like the participation ratio (a measure of the spread of eigenvalues in the feature covariance matrix). A pivotal configuration is the application of dropout **only to the final embedding layer** (the pre-classifier features) rather than throughout the network, which is identified as the most effective strategy. Other critical experimental parameters include the use of a **linear probing-style setup** (only the classification head is trained initially, followed by full fine-tuning) and comparisons across different **dropout schedulers** (constant vs. decaying).

Subsequently, the researchers systematically evaluate the resulting models not only on standard, idealized benchmarks but also under three formally defined non-ideal scenarios derived from real-world reasoning challenges: summary inference (synthesizing multiple possibilities), fine-grained noise suppression (discerning signal from subtle noise), and contextual filtering (isolating relevant evidence from extensive information). This design allows for a direct comparison of model performance between ideal and non-ideal conditions after identical RL optimization.\n\nThe data collection and evaluation are conducted using eight public datasets, which serve as the testbeds for both the standard and the perturbed scenarios. While the specific datasets are not enumerated in the provided excerpt, the text references common reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K (mathematical reasoning), MATH (advanced mathematics), and commonsense evaluations. The non-ideal conditions are operationalized by introducing controlled imperfections into these datasets or their inputs, simulating the three challenging scenarios. The primary data sources are therefore these established public benchmarks, which are repurposed to create the non-ideal test conditions, ensuring the findings are grounded in widely recognized evaluation frameworks.\n\nThe analysis technique is primarily quantitative, centered on performance comparison before and after RL fine-tuning across the different experimental conditions. The key metric is reasoning accuracy or performance on the target tasks, measured under both ideal and non-ideal settings. The critical analytical contrast is the divergence between performance gains in ideal settings and performance declines in non-ideal ones. Furthermore, the methodology includes proposing and testing a scenario-specific remediation method, the results of which are analyzed to determine the extent to which it resolves the identified deficits. Key configurations involve the use of a policy gradient RL algorithm for fine-tuning, applied uniformly across the selected models, and the specific parameters defining the three non-ideal input conditions (summary, noise, and context), which are central to the experimental manipulation.

      "abstract": "The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since large language models (LLMs) first appeared. Yet, their massive memory consumption has become a significant roadblock to large-scale training. For instance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full parameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to high-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not reach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is dis",

      "methodology": "**Study Design and Approach**\n\nThe research employs an empirical, hypothesis-driven methodology to develop a novel fine-tuning algorithm. The core approach is a two-stage process: first, a diagnostic comparative study is conducted to identify a key behavioral difference between Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and full-parameter fine-tuning. The authors hypothesize that understanding this difference can lead to a more memory-efficient method that retains the performance benefits of full-parameter updates. This diagnostic phase motivates the second stage: the design and proposal of Layerwise Importance Sampling for AdamW (LISA). LISA is an algorithmic intervention that strategically freezes and unfreezes network layers during training based on a sampling distribution derived from the observed LoRA update patterns. The design aims to emulate LoRA's purported efficiency in learning language features while avoiding its inherent low-rank representational limitations, thereby creating a hybrid method that balances memory efficiency and model capacity.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\n\nThe empirical analysis relies on internal metrics collected during controlled training runs rather than on external benchmark datasets for evaluation. The primary data source is the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset, used for fine-tuning the studied models. The key collected metric is the **mean weight norm per layer**, defined as the average L2 norm of a layer's parameters over the course of training. This data is collected for both full-parameter fine-tuning and LoRA-based fine-tuning across two model architectures: GPT-2 and LLaMA-2-7B. The visualization of this layer-wise metric (Figure 2) serves as the foundational evidence for the observed discrepancy—specifically, that embedding and language modeling head layers exhibit dramatically larger weight norms under LoRA compared to intermediate layers, a pattern not salient in full-parameter training.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\n\nThe primary analysis technique is comparative visualization and qualitative interpretation of the layer-wise weight norm trajectories. The authors use these observations to inform a probabilistic sampling framework. They apply **importance sampling** principles to derive a layer sampling probability \\( p^{(\\ell)} \\) proportional to the ratio of LoRA's layer weight norms to those of full-parameter training. In practice, this is simplified to a configuration where only the embedding and head layers are always active, while a fixed number (\\( \\gamma \\)) of intermediate layers are randomly unfrozen per sampling period. Key algorithmic parameters include: the number of model layers (\\( N_L \\)), the **sampling period (\\( K \\))** dictating how many optimization steps occur between layer resampling events, the **number of sampled layers (\\( \\gamma \\))** which controls memory consumption and update sparsity, and the base learning rate (\\( \\eta_0 \\)). The method is implemented as a modified AdamW optimizer that cyclically freezes and unfreezes subsets of parameters according to this stochastic schedule.",

The core approach is structured around three sequential and complementary fine-tuning strategies, systematically evaluated on the challenging MATH dataset. The first strategy, **Supervised Step-by-Step Solution Fine-Tuning (SSFT)**, serves as a baseline, training the model to generate detailed, step-by-step solutions. Building upon this, the second strategy, **Solution-Cluster Re-ranking (SCR)**, fine-tunes the model as a solution verifier to evaluate and rank multiple candidate solution clusters, thereby improving discriminative ability. The third strategy, **Multi-task Sequential Fine-Tuning**, integrates generation and evaluation tasks in a staged training process to efficiently enhance overall performance. The study design is explicitly guided by the empirical observation of a large gap between pass-at-one and pass-at-N performance in pre-trained models, framing the research problem as one of improving both solution generation fidelity and solution discrimination.\n\nThe primary data source for both training and evaluation is the **MATH dataset**, a comprehensive benchmark of challenging, competition-level mathematics problems. For the SSFT phase, the models are fine-tuned using curated step-by-step solutions, with the study noting that the **quality and style** of these solutions significantly impact final performance. For the SCR and multi-task phases, data is derived from candidate solutions generated by the model itself, which are then clustered. The analysis relies on the standard **accuracy** metric for the MATH dataset, defined as the percentage of problems for which the final answer matches the ground truth. A key comparative metric is **pass@N**, which measures the probability of at least one correct answer in N sampled solutions. The study meticulously compares fine-tuned model performance against the **few-shot performance of pre-trained PaLM 2 models**, using both greedy decoding and sampling with **majority voting** as critical baselines.\n\nThe analysis techniques are predominantly empirical and comparative, centered on ablation studies across the proposed fine-tuning strategies. The core analytical method involves training variants of **PaLM 2 models** (specifically the \"L\" size) with different configurations—SSFT only, SSFT+SCR, and sequential multi-task fine-tuning—and evaluating their accuracy.

      "methodology": "This study presents a methodological framework designed to address the generalization-specialization trade-off inherent in fine-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The core approach is a **parameter importance-aware weight allocation strategy** that selectively updates model parameters during downstream fine-tuning. The methodology is predicated on the empirical observation of a **Parameter Importance Difference (PID)**, quantified as the cosine distance between two vectors: the absolute values of the pre-trained weights (\\(|w^*|\\)) and the absolute values of the accumulated fine-tuning gradients (\\(|g|\\)). The authors hypothesize that a high PID indicates a conflict between the knowledge required for the upstream (pre-training) and downstream (fine-tuning) distributions. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, their proposed strategy calculates importance scores for both distributions—using frozen weight magnitude for upstream importance and gradient magnitude for downstream importance—and then allocates a larger update budget to parameters deemed important for the downstream task while being less critical for the upstream knowledge, thereby preserving generalized capabilities.\n\nFor empirical validation, the authors employ a **comparative experimental design** across multiple established MLLM architectures and benchmark tasks. The primary data sources are standard vision-language datasets used for **image captioning** (e.g., Flickr30k) and **visual question answering (VQA)** (e.g., OKVQA), which serve as both fine-tuning and evaluation distributions. The methodology involves fine-tuning models like LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, following the common practice of freezing the visual encoder (e.g., CLIP-ViT) and updating only the connector module and the Large Language Model (LLM) component. This setup creates a controlled environment to isolate and analyze the effects of their proposed selective update mechanism on the tunable parameters.\n\nThe analysis techniques are both quantitative and diagnostic. Performance is evaluated using standard task-specific metrics, such as **CIDEr** for captioning and **accuracy** for VQA, to measure specialization gains on the fine-tuned task. Crucially, to assess generalization preservation, the authors employ **out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation** on datasets not seen during fine-tuning. The key methodological configuration is the algorithm for ranking and selecting parameters for updates based on the computed importance scores, which introduces a hyperparameter controlling the proportion of parameters updated. The paper's central figure (Figure 1) visually summarizes the diagnostic metric (PID) that motivates the entire approach, demonstrating a higher PID for unseen downstream distributions compared to seen ones, thereby justifying the need for an importance-aware fine-tuning strategy to balance conflicting learning signals.",

The core approach is a multi-stage fine-tuning pipeline. First, **instruction template compression** is performed to distill verbose, human-written instructions into a concise, model-digestible format. Second, **few-shot example absorption** fine-tunes the model on these examples, enabling it to learn the demonstrated task patterns without requiring their explicit inclusion in future prompts. Finally, a **progressive internalization strategy** is employed, where the model is first fine-tuned with the full compressed prompt and then gradually weaned off it in subsequent training stages, forcing the internalization of the prompt knowledge. This design contrasts with prompt compression methods that operate on a static, pre-trained model; instead, PromptIntern actively modifies the model parameters through fine-tuning to obviate the need for lengthy prompts during inference.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\nThe methodology is evaluated on challenging **NL2Code (Natural Language to Code)** tasks, a domain where prompts are typically long due to complex instructions and in-context examples. The paper utilizes established benchmarks, specifically the **MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Programming)** and **HumanEval** datasets, which are standard for evaluating code generation capabilities.

Key **metrics** include: (1) **Token Reduction**, measuring the decrease in input length; (2) **Inference Speedup** (latency reduction); (3) **Monetary Cost Saving**, calculated based on cloud API pricing per token; and (4) **Accuracy**, using the standard pass@k metric for code generation to ensure task performance is maintained. The **key configurations** involve the fine-tuning protocol itself, notably the use of **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** techniques, such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), to minimize the computational overhead of the internalization process. Comparisons are made against strong baselines, including models using full prompts and those employing external prompt compression techniques. The progressive internalization schedule—defining how and when the compressed prompt is removed during training—is a critical hyperparameter of the method. The results demonstrate that PromptIntern significantly reduces input tokens (>90%), accelerates inference (4.2x), and cuts costs (88.3%) while preserving competitive accuracy on the NL2Code benchmarks.",

The core methodology, termed **Point-PEFT**, is structured around two principal components integrated into frozen pre-trained backbones: a **Point-prior Prompt** and a **Geometry-aware Adapter**. The Point-prior Prompt introduces learnable tokens enhanced by a memory bank of domain-specific knowledge and a parameter-free attention mechanism, aiming to inject task-relevant cues without altering the original model weights. The Geometry-aware Adapter is designed to capture fine-grained local geometric structures by aggregating features within spatial neighborhoods, addressing the irregular and sparse nature of point cloud data.

Specifically, the authors utilize **ModelNet40** (a dataset of 12,311 CAD models from 40 object categories) for shape classification, as highlighted in the comparative analysis (Figure 1). Additional downstream tasks likely involve datasets for part segmentation (e.g., ShapeNetPart) and object detection (e.g., ScanObjectNN), though these are implied rather than detailed in the provided excerpt.

The methodology emphasizes ablation studies to validate the contributions of each component (Point-prior Prompt and Geometry-aware Adapter). Key technical configurations include the use of a **memory bank** to store domain priors for prompt enhancement and a **local feature aggregation mechanism** within adapters to model geometric relationships. The framework is implemented with a strict parameter efficiency constraint, limiting trainable parameters to approximately 5% of the full model.

However, as the base classes have no overlap to the novel set, simply transferring whole knowledge from base data is not an optimal solution since some knowledge in the base model may be biased or even harmful to the novel class.

The core methodological design is an intervention on the standard pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, hypothesizing that indiscriminate, full-model fine-tuning on limited novel-class data can be suboptimal due to potential negative transfer from base-class biases. The authors' approach is to implement a **partial transfer strategy**, wherein only a selected subset of layers in the pre-trained model is fine-tuned, while others remain frozen. To refine this further, they introduce **layer-wise adaptive learning rates** for the fine-tuned layers, allowing for granular control over the extent of knowledge preservation versus adaptation. The central innovation is the development of an **evolutionary search-based method** to automatically and efficiently determine two key hyperparameters simultaneously: which specific layers to recast and what individual learning rate to assign to each.\n\nThe methodology is empirically validated using standard FSL benchmarks to ensure comparability. The primary datasets are **CUB-200-2011** (a fine-grained bird classification dataset) and **mini-ImageNet** (a standard subset of ImageNet for FSL). The experimental protocol follows the established episodic evaluation paradigm, where models are first pre-trained on a set of base classes with abundant data and then evaluated on a disjoint set of novel classes using only a few (e.g., 1 or 5) labeled examples per class (support set). The analysis technique is primarily comparative, benchmarking the proposed partial transfer strategy against state-of-the-art methods across two major FSL frameworks: **meta-learning-based** (e.g., RelationNet, ProtoNet) and **non-meta, or \"baseline++,\" fine-tuning-based** approaches. The key performance metric is the **average classification accuracy** on the novel-class query sets across numerous randomly sampled episodes, reported separately for 1-shot and 5-shot settings.\n\nThe key configurable parameters of the method are defined by the evolutionary search algorithm. The search space consists of a binary vector (indicating freeze/fine-tune per layer) and a continuous vector for the corresponding learning rates. The evolutionary algorithm uses **tournament selection** and **simulated binary crossover** to evolve a population of these configurations, with fitness evaluated by the validation accuracy on a small held-out set of novel-class episodes. This design allows for efficient, gradient-free optimization of the complex, non-differentiable hyperparameter space. Importantly, the method is also extended to conventional pre-training + fine-tuning outside the strict episodic meta-learning setup, demonstrating its generality. The results analysis hinges on ablation studies to isolate the contribution of partial layer freezing versus adaptive learning rates, and comparisons to heuristic strategies (e.g., only fine-tuning the last layer or all layers uniformly), ultimately showing that the evolutionarily discovered configurations consistently outperform full-model fine-tuning and achieve state-of-the-art results.",

      "methodology": "**Study Design and Approach**\nThis study employs an experimental design to investigate the efficacy of instruction tuning for enhancing the domain-specific machine translation (MT) performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). The core approach involves a comparative analysis between baseline LLMs and their instruction-tuned counterparts. The intervention is the creation and application of instruction-formatted fine-tuning datasets that incorporate specialised medical terminology, framed as translation constraints or glossaries within the prompts. The research is grounded in the premise that instruction tuning can improve an LLM's ability to follow explicit translation directives, thereby addressing known deficiencies in terminology consistency and accuracy within the medical domain. The study frames controlled MT generation—adhering to correct terminology, syntax, and document structure—as an instruction-following task, aiming to bridge the performance gap between general-purpose LLMs and standard neural MT models in this high-risk, low-resource domain.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\nThe methodology utilizes existing corpora and models, with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) corpus explicitly mentioned as a source of domain-specific translation segments containing specialised terminology. The fine-tuning data is constructed by formatting translation pairs into instructional prompts. A key methodological feature is the intentional integration of medical dictionaries or terminology rules into these prompts, exemplified by the template: \"Glossary: [source term] -> [target term]. Translate the source text from [source language] to [target language] following the provided translation glossaries.\" This structured data generation technique transforms parallel text into a supervised fine-tuning dataset that teaches the model to condition its output on provided terminology constraints. The baseline and instruction-tuned models are likely based on open-source LLMs like Llama-2, following the precedent set by cited related work (Alves et al., 2024).\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\nPerformance is evaluated using automatic MT metrics, though specific metrics (e.g., BLEU, COMET) are not named in the provided excerpt. A significant and detailed component of the analysis is an error analysis based on automatic annotation, which is used to quantify the reduction in specific translation error types in the instruction-tuned models compared to the baselines. The key configurable parameters inherent to the method involve the design of the instruction prompts, specifically the strategy for incorporating terminology constraints (glossaries) and potentially other translation instructions. The fine-tuning process itself, including its scale (full or parameter-efficient) and hyperparameters, constitutes another critical configuration, though these technical details are not specified in the provided text. The evaluation ultimately contrasts two primary conditions: the baseline LLM's zero-shot or standard prompted translation capability versus the performance of the same model after being fine-tuned on the domain-aware, instruction-formatted dataset.",

EcomInstruct scales up the data size and task diversity by constructing atomic tasks with E-commerce basic data types, such as product information, user reviews.

      "methodology": "This study presents a methodological framework for developing a domain-specific large language model (LLM) for e-commerce through structured instruction tuning. The core design involves the construction of a novel, large-scale instruction dataset, **EcomInstruct**, and its use to fine-tune the publicly available multilingual model **BLOOMZ**. The authors' approach is predicated on the hypothesis that general LLMs like ChatGPT underperform on e-commerce tasks due to the domain's unique data characteristics, including complex product information structures, emerging entities, and concise, entity-heavy text. To bridge this gap, they introduce a **Chain-of-Task** paradigm, where complex final tasks (e.g., product title generation) are decomposed into fundamental \"atomic tasks\" (e.g., entity recognition, sentiment analysis on reviews). By instruction-tuning on these atomic tasks derived from basic e-commerce data types—such as product attributes and user reviews—the model, dubbed **EcomGPT**, is designed to acquire robust fundamental semantic understanding, thereby enhancing its zero-shot generalization across diverse and unseen e-commerce datasets and tasks.\n\nThe data collection and synthesis methodology is central to this work. The authors construct the **EcomInstruct** dataset, comprising 2.5 million instruction-output pairs. The data sources are foundational e-commerce data types, including product information (e.g., structured attributes, unstructured titles) and user reviews. The key innovation lies in the task construction process: rather than collecting end-task instructions alone, the methodology involves defining and generating a wide variety of atomic tasks that implicitly form the reasoning chain for solving higher-level objectives. This process scales both the size and the task diversity of the dataset. The resulting instructions cover a broad spectrum, from attribute extraction and review topic classification to product title generation, as illustrated in the provided examples. The analysis techniques are primarily empirical and comparative. The performance of different parameter scales of EcomGPT is evaluated against a strong baseline, **ChatGPT**, through extensive automated experiments and human evaluations. The metrics, while not explicitly listed in the provided text, are implied to be task-specific (e.g., accuracy for classification, quality for generation) focusing on **cross-dataset and cross-task generalization** in a zero-shot setting.\n\nKey configurations of the methodology include the choice of the base model (**BLOOMZ**), the scale of the instruction dataset (**2.5 million instances**), and the foundational principle of **Chain-of-Task task construction**. The training process involves standard instruction-tuning of the backbone model on the EcomInstruct dataset. The methodological success is evidenced by the reported outcomes: EcomGPT demonstrates superior zero-shot performance compared to ChatGPT on challenging e-commerce scenarios. These include comprehending short, entity-only sentences for attribute extraction, generalizing to emerging entities like new shop names for topic classification, and correctly interpreting structurally complex input (e.g., key-value pairs) for coherent title generation, where general LLMs may fail or resort to mechanical splicing. Thus, the methodology validates the efficacy of domain-specific instruction tuning with a Chain-of-Task designed dataset for building specialized LLMs with enhanced generalization.",

The approach is predicated on the hypothesis that models pre-trained on code completion lack the specific alignment for editing tasks, which require understanding an existing code context and executing precise, instruction-following modifications. The study evaluates the efficacy of fine-tuning on InstructCoder by comparing the performance of adapted models against both baseline open-source LLMs and advanced proprietary models (e.g., ChatGPT) on the held-out EditEval benchmark.\n\nThe data collection methodology is iterative and hybrid, leveraging both existing sources and synthetic generation. The **InstructCoder** dataset, comprising over 114,000 instruction-input-output triplets, is initiated using filtered commit data from GitHub Python repositories as seed tasks. This seed data is then systematically expanded through an iterative prompting process where both the original seeds and newly generated tasks are used to prompt ChatGPT (specifically, the `gpt-3.5-turbo` API) to produce further diverse examples.

The study compares models before and after instruction-tuning on InstructCoder, analyzing performance gains across different editing task categories. Key configurations include the use of open-source base LLMs (e.g., CodeLlama, StarCoder) for fine-tuning, the application of standard supervised fine-tuning techniques on the collected triplet data, and the strategic use of a powerful proprietary LLM (ChatGPT) as both a data augmenter and a performance benchmark.

The primary objective is to identify the most effective graph representation format for bridging the structural gap between graphs and the textual understanding of LLMs, and to subsequently analyze the generalization capabilities of the resulting instruction-tuned models. The approach is explicitly framed as filling a research gap, moving beyond prior works that propose single representation formats (e.g., natural language or code-like formats) by conducting a controlled comparison to determine which representation—JSON, natural language, or DOT code—consistently yields superior performance across diverse models and graph types.\n\nFor data collection and benchmark construction, the authors manually curated a comprehensive dataset named **GraphInstruct**, comprising 79 distinct graph-related tasks sourced from academic and e-commerce domains. This dataset is substantial, containing **44,240 training instances and 18,960 test samples**, which allows for robust instruction tuning and evaluation. The tasks are designed to be fine-grained, enabling a deeper analysis of model capabilities than prior benchmarks with fewer tasks. The graph data is systematically converted into three candidate representation formats: a structured **JSON** format, a fluent **natural language** description, and a **DOT** code-like format (a graph description language). This multi-format dataset serves as the controlled substrate for the primary experimental variable: graph representation.\n\nThe analysis techniques are primarily quantitative and comparative, evaluating model performance on the constructed benchmark. The key metric for identifying the optimal representation is task-specific accuracy (or analogous performance metrics) across various LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, GPT variants) and graph types. Following the identification of the optimal format, the study shifts to a generalization analysis, where the instruction-tuned models are evaluated on both **in-domain** (tasks seen during training) and **out-of-domain** graph tasks. The out-of-domain evaluation is designed to test generalization to new task requirements, unseen graph structure distributions, and novel algorithms, which is a critical assessment for a general-purpose graph solver. Key configurations include the choice of base LLMs for instruction tuning, the hyperparameters of the tuning process itself, and the systematic ablation of representation formats as the independent variable. The methodology culminates in a holistic evaluation that not only identifies JSON as the superior graph representation conduit for LLMs but also provides empirical insights into the factors that influence the tuned models' ability to generalize across the complex landscape of graph-related problems.",

    "review_text": "### **A Narrative Review of Fine-Tuning Strategies for Large Language Models**\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nThe fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on specialized datasets has emerged as the predominant paradigm for aligning these models with human intent and adapting them to specific tasks. As the field moves beyond foundational pre-training, the research question of *how to optimally fine-tune* has become critically significant, directly impacting the performance, robustness, and efficiency of deployed models. This review synthesizes recent literature to examine the evolving methodologies for LLM fine-tuning, focusing on strategies for instruction data curation, learning from suboptimal data, regularization for generalization, and efficiency. While substantial progress has been made in empirical recipe development, a persistent gap exists in mechanistic explanations for observed phenomena. This narrative review will first analyze key thematic advancements, critically discuss methodological trends and limitations, identify salient research gaps, and conclude by outlining the trajectory for future work in this foundational area of LLM development.\n\n**THEMATIC ANALYSIS**\n\n**Instruction Data Curation and Composition**\nA primary focus of recent research is the strategic assembly of instruction data, moving beyond naive aggregation toward principled composition to elicit desired capabilities. A central finding is that not all data mixtures are equally beneficial. [Demystifying Instruction Mixing, 2023] demonstrates that combining diverse instruction types—such as NLP downstream tasks, coding, and general chat—does not uniformly improve performance; NLP task data can even degrade conversational ability despite improving task-specific benchmarks. This indicates potential negative interference between different instructional objectives. Conversely, the same study identifies positive transfer, where coding data enhances not only coding proficiency but also general chat capabilities, suggesting that certain domains may teach broadly useful reasoning or structural patterns. The capacity to manage this interplay is scale-dependent, with larger models better able to integrate diverse mixtures and mitigate interference, likely due to their greater representational and optimization stability.\n\nTo address the scarcity of high-quality data, automated generation techniques have been developed. [WizardLM, 2023] introduces Evol-Instruct, a method using an LLM to iteratively \"evolve\" seed instructions into more complex variants. Fine-tuning on this AI-generated data produces models that outperform those trained on human-created datasets on complex tasks, demonstrating that synthetic data can surpass human data in driving performance on specific capability frontiers. This approach contrasts with the curation-focused work of [Demystifying Instruction Mixing, 2023], which emphasizes selecting and balancing existing data sources. Together, they highlight a spectrum of strategies: careful *composition* of existing datasets versus *generation* of novel, targeted data. An area of agreement is the rejection of the \"more is always better\" heuristic; both lines of work underscore that data quality, complexity, and domain are more critical than sheer volume.\n\n**Learning from Negative or Suboptimal Data**\nComplementing data curation, a novel strand of research explores leveraging failure cases and suboptimal trajectories to improve model robustness and data efficiency, particularly for agentic applications. Challenging the paradigm of using only successful examples, [Learning From Failure, 2024] shows that incorporating negative (unsuccessful) interaction trajectories during fine-tuning significantly boosts performance on reasoning and question-answering tasks. This turns a typically wasted resource—the majority of trajectories in exploratory agent scenarios may be failures—into a valuable training signal. The study further finds that a simple Negative-Aware Training (NAT) paradigm, which prepends or appends a token signaling the success or failure of a trajectory, is more effective than naively mixing positive and negative examples. This structured approach provides a better trade-off, allowing the model to learn *from* the failure without being trained *to* reproduce it.\n\nThis methodology represents a significant shift from standard instruction tuning, which primarily uses positive exemplars. It aligns with a broader understanding that learning often requires exposure to contrastive or incorrect examples to sharpen decision boundaries and improve reasoning. While [Learning From Failure, 2024] applies this to agent trajectories, the core principle may have broader applicability in calibration, safety, and chain-of-thought reasoning, where understanding why an answer is wrong is as important as knowing the correct one. The success of NAT, a minimal-intervention technique, also suggests that even simple metadata can powerfully modulate the learning objective during fine-tuning, a finding that intersects with work on prompt-based conditioning.\n\n**Regularization and Generalization Strategies for Fine-Tuning**\nAs fine-tuning often occurs on smaller, task-specific datasets, a major concern is overfitting and poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Innovative regularization strategies have been proposed to address this. Counter-intuitively, [Fine-tuning with Very Large Dropout, 2024] demonstrates that applying extremely high dropout rates (e.g., >90%) during fine-tuning is not only viable but highly effective for OOD generalization, outperforming more computationally expensive methods like ensembles. The authors argue that this promotes \"rich representations\" that retain redundant features not critical for in-distribution performance but beneficial for handling novel distributions. This success is mechanistically linked to the \"intrinsically linear\" nature of fine-tuning a large pre-trained model on a small dataset, where parameter changes are modest, allowing for such aggressive regularization without catastrophic forgetting or collapse.\n\nThis approach challenges the implicit sparsity bias of standard training and offers a computationally cheap alternative to ensemble methods. It situates fine-tuning within a broader representation learning framework, suggesting that the goal is not merely to adapt to a new task but to preserve and strategically *deteriorate* the pre-trained representation in a controlled way to enhance robustness. This perspective contrasts with, yet could be complementary to, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which seek to minimize changes to the pre-trained weights. While PEFT methods like LoRA inherently constrain updates, [Fine-tuning with Very Large Dropout, 2024] applies a stochastic constraint during training, raising questions about their combined effects.\n\n**Efficiency and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**\nAlthough not detailed in the provided excerpts, PEFT is a dominant theme in the fine-tuning literature that critically enables the practical adaptation of LLMs. Techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), prefix-tuning, and adapter layers allow for effective model adaptation by updating only a small, injected subset of parameters, drastically reducing memory and storage requirements. The core premise is that the pre-trained model already contains a vast repository of general knowledge; adaptation requires only a low-dimensional re-projection or a small set of task-specific adjustments. PEFT methods democratize fine-tuning by making it feasible with consumer-grade hardware and are essential for managing many deployed task-specific variants of a base model.\n\nThe relationship between PEFT and other thematic areas is underexplored. For instance, how does instruction data composition affect the optimal rank in LoRA? Does learning from negative examples require a different parameter budget than learning from positive ones? Does the aggressive dropout proposed by [Fine-tuning with Very Large Dropout, 2024] interact synergistically or antagonistically with the low-rank updates of LoRA? PEFT is often treated as an independent engineering solution, but its integration with strategic data curation and advanced regularization presents a rich area for investigation.\n\n**Evaluation and Benchmarking of Fine-Tuned Models**\nUnderpinning all thematic advances is the critical challenge of evaluation. A consistent pattern across studies is reliance on a combination of automated benchmarks and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. While benchmarks like HumanEval (for code) or GSM8K (for math) provide standardized metrics, they are narrow and may not capture nuanced capabilities like conversational fluency or safety [Demystifying Instruction Mixing, 2023]. The use of powerful LLMs like GPT-4 as evaluators, as seen in [WizardLM, 2023], introduces risks of circularity and bias, particularly when the same family of models is used for data generation (e.g., Evol-Instruct using ChatGPT). This creates an opaque feedback loop where success may be partially measured by similarity to the judge model's own outputs.\n\nFurthermore, evaluations often reveal task-specific trade-offs. Improvement on one benchmark (e.g., NLP tasks) does not guarantee improvement on another (e.g., chat), highlighting the multifaceted nature of \"model quality\" [Demystifying Instruction Mixing, 2023]. This necessitates comprehensive evaluation suites, yet the field lacks consensus on a holistic framework that balances automated, human, and interactive assessments across capabilities, robustness, and alignment.\n\n**CRITICAL DISCUSSION**\n\nThe literature reveals a field progressing rapidly through empirical discovery but grappling with explanatory depth. A dominant trend is the development of simple, effective heuristics—whether for data mixing, adding failure prefixes, or applying extreme dropout—that yield significant performance gains. The effectiveness of minimal-intervention techniques (NAT prefixes, high dropout) is particularly noteworthy, suggesting that the fine-tuning process is highly sensitive to modest changes in the training objective or dynamics. However, this empirical success often outpaces theoretical understanding. As noted in multiple studies, there is a lack of mechanistic explanation for *why* coding data aids chat, *why* negative trajectories help, or *why* large dropout aids OOD generalization [Demystifying Instruction Mixing, 2023; Learning From Failure, 2024]. The findings are largely descriptive, identifying *what* works but not *how* it works at the level of representations, optimization landscapes, or gradient dynamics.\n\nMethodologically, the field faces several interconnected limitations. First, there is a siloing of research threads: data curation, regularization, and efficiency techniques are typically studied in isolation. The interaction between, for example, AI-evolved data and very-large-dropout fine-tuning is unknown, limiting the development of integrated, optimal pipelines. Second, evaluation remains a persistent vulnerability. Over-reliance on narrow benchmarks and potentially circular LLM-based evaluation threatens the validity and generalizability of claims. Third, many studies are conducted on a limited set of model architectures (often the LLaMA family) and scales, raising questions about the universality of the proposed techniques.\n\nThese methodological choices are often pragmatic, driven by the high cost of experimentation. However, they collectively point to a need for more foundational research that seeks unifying principles. The field would benefit from a shift toward controlled experiments designed to test specific hypotheses about learning dynamics, greater use of probing and interpretability tools to understand representational changes, and the establishment of more rigorous, multi-faceted evaluation protocols that mitigate bias.\n\n**GAPS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS**\n\nThe synthesized literature points to several key research gaps. Foremost is the **lack of mechanistic understanding** of interference, transfer, and regularization effects during fine-tuning. Future work should move beyond reporting empirical recipes to develop testable theories and diagnostic tools that explain phenomena at the level of optimization and representation. Second, the **interaction between data strategies and fine-tuning methods** is severely under-explored. Research is needed to systematically study how data composition, synthetic generation, and the inclusion of negative examples interact with different PEFT methods, regularization techniques, and optimizer choices. Third, there is **limited validation in complex, open-ended scenarios**. Methods like NAT and advanced instruction tuning require testing in long-horizon, multi-turn interactive environments (e.g., embodied agents, sustained dialogue) to assess their generalizability. Fourth, the **evaluation paradigm needs reform**. Developing benchmarks that are less gameable, reducing circularity in LLM-as-judge setups, and incorporating more human-in-the-loop and real-world deployment metrics are crucial. Finally, the **scalability and limits of data generation techniques** like Evol-Instruct require investigation, particularly regarding complexity ceilings, iterative evolution stability, and long-tail distributional risks.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThis review has charted the evolving landscape of LLM fine-tuning, highlighting significant advancements in the strategic curation and generation of instruction data, the innovative use of negative examples, the application of aggressive regularization for generalization, and the pursuit of parameter efficiency. The collective findings underscore that fine-tuning is a highly delicate process where the composition of data, the construction of the learning signal, and the constraints placed on optimization profoundly shape model capabilities and robustness. While the community has developed a powerful toolkit of effective heuristics, the prevailing limitation is a descriptive rather than explanatory understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Addressing this gap, alongside improving evaluation rigor and exploring the integration of disparate fine-tuning strategies, represents the critical frontier for future research. As LLMs continue to permeate applications, moving from empirical fine-tuning \"alchemy\" to a principled engineering science will be essential for developing reliable, robust, and efficient models.",
