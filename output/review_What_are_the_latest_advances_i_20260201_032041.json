        "abstract": "On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of $\\sim$1.7 s with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg$^2$ at a luminosity distance of $40^{+8}_{-8}$ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 Msun. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at $\\sim$40 Mpc) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over $\\sim$10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient's position $\\sim$9 and $\\sim$16 days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. (Abridged)",

        "abstract": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in many domains, they still have a tendency to hallucinate and generate fictitious responses to user requests. This problem can be alleviated by augmenting LLMs with information retrieval (IR) systems (also known as retrieval-augmented LLMs). Applying this strategy, LLMs can generate more factual texts in response to user input according to the relevant content retrieved by IR systems from external corpora as references. In addition, by incorporating external knowledge, retrieval-augmented LLMs can answer in-domain questions that cannot be answered by solely relying on the world knowledge stored in parameters. To support research in this area and facilitate the development of retrieval-augmented LLM systems, we develop RETA-LLM, a {RET}reival-{A}ugmented LLM toolkit. In RETA-LLM, we create a complete pipeline to help researchers and users build their customized in-domain LLM-based systems. Compared with previous retrieval-augmented LLM systems, RETA-LLM provides more plug-and-play modules to support better interaction between IR systems and LLMs, including {request rewriting, document retrieval, passage extraction, answer generation, and fact checking} modules. Our toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-IR/tree/main/RETA-LLM.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a Fully BInarized Large Language Model (FBI-LLM), demonstrating for the first time how to train a large-scale binary language model from scratch (not the partial binary or ternary LLM like BitNet b1.58) to match the performance of its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) in transformer-based LLMs. It achieves this by employing an autoregressive distillation (AD) loss with maintaining equivalent model dimensions (130M, 1.3B, 7B) and training data volume as regular LLM pretraining, while delivering competitive results in terms of perplexity and task-specific effectiveness. Intriguingly, by analyzing the training trajectory, we find that the pretrained weight is not necessary for training binarized LLMs from scratch. This research encourages a new computational framework and may facilitate the future design of specialized hardware tailored for fully 1-bit LLMs. We make all models, code, and training dataset fully accessible and transparent to support further research (Code: https://github.com/LiqunMa/FBI-LLM.

        "abstract": "LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely applied to evaluate and compare different LLM alignmnet approaches (e.g., RLHF and DPO). However, concerns regarding its reliability have emerged, due to LLM judges' biases and inconsistent decision-making. Previous research has developed evaluation frameworks to assess reliability of LLM judges and their alignment with human preferences. However, the employed evaluation metrics often lack adequate explainability and fail to address LLM internal inconsistency. Additionally, existing studies inadequately explore the impact of various prompt templates when applying LLM-as-a-Judge methods, leading to potentially inconsistent comparisons between different alignment algorithms. In this work, we systematically evaluate LLM-as-a-Judge on alignment tasks by defining more theoretically interpretable evaluation metrics and explicitly mitigating LLM internal inconsistency from reliability metrics. We develop an open-source framework to evaluate, compare, and visualize the reliability and alignment of LLM judges, which facilitates practitioners to choose LLM judges for alignment tasks. In the experiments, we examine effects of diverse prompt templates on LLM-judge reliability and also demonstrate our developed framework by comparing various LLM judges on two common alignment datasets (i.e., TL;DR Summarization and HH-RLHF-Helpfulness). Our results indicate a significant impact of prompt templates on LLM judge performance, as well as a mediocre alignment level between the tested LLM judges and human evaluators.",

        "abstract": "Reasoning is a cognitive process of using evidence to reach a sound conclusion. The reasoning capability is essential for large language models (LLMs) to serve as the brain of the artificial general intelligence agent. Recent studies reveal that fine-tuning LLMs on data with the chain of thought (COT) reasoning process can significantly enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, we find that the fine-tuned LLMs suffer from an \\textit{Assessment Misalignment} problem, i.e., they frequently assign higher scores to subpar COTs, leading to potential limitations in their reasoning abilities. To address this problem, we introduce an \\textit{Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT)} paradigm, which involves three steps: 1) fine-tuning LLMs with COT training data; 2) generating multiple COT responses for each question, and categorizing them into positive and negative ones based on whether they achieve the correct answer; 3) calibrating the scores of positive and negative responses given by LLMs with a novel constraint alignment loss. Specifically, the constraint alignment loss has two objectives: a) Alignment, which guarantees that positive scores surpass negative scores to encourage answers with high-quality COTs; b) Constraint, which keeps the negative scores confined to a reasonable range to prevent the model degradation. Beyond just the binary positive and negative feedback, the constraint alignment loss can be seamlessly adapted to the ranking situations when ranking feedback is accessible. Furthermore, we also delve deeply into recent ranking-based alignment methods, such as DPO, RRHF, and PRO, and discover that the constraint, which has been overlooked by these approaches, is also crucial for their performance. Extensive experiments on four reasoning benchmarks with both binary and ranking feedback demonstrate the effectiveness of AFT.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic, non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM) using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios.

In AI-augmented reasoning, interventions that disrupt the state of cognitive flow can hinder rather than enhance decision-making. This paper proposes a context-aware cognitive augmentation framework that adapts interventions based on three key contextual factors: type, timing, and scale. By leveraging multimodal behavioral cues (e.g., gaze behavior, typing hesitation, interaction speed), AI can dynamically adjust cognitive support to maintain or restore flow. We introduce the concept of cognitive flow, an extension of flow theory in AI-augmented reasoning, where interventions are personalized, adaptive, and minimally intrusive. By shifting from static interventions to context-aware augmentation, our approach ensures that AI systems support deep engagement in complex decision-making and reasoning without disrupting cognitive immersion.",

In MASTER, a multimodal system translates natural language into density functional theory workflows, while higher-level reasoning agents guide discovery through a hierarchy of strategies, including a single agent baseline and three multi-agent approaches: peer review, triage-ranking, and triage-forms. Across two chemical applications, CO adsorption on Cu-surface transition metal (M) adatoms and on M-N-C catalysts, reasoning-driven exploration reduces required atomistic simulations by up to 90% relative to trial-and-error selection. Reasoning trajectories reveal chemically grounded decisions that cannot be explained by stochastic sampling or semantic bias.

The basic idea of CoT is to let LLMs break down their thought processes step-by-step by putting exemplars in the input prompt. However, the densely structured prompt exemplars of CoT may cause the cognitive overload of LLMs. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce COT-SEP, a method that strategically employs separators at the end of each exemplar in CoT prompting. These separators are designed to help the LLMs understand their thought processes better while reasoning. Interestingly, it turns out that COT-SEP significantly improves the LLMs' performances on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K, AQuA, CSQA), compared with the vanilla CoT, which does not use separators. We also study the effects of the type and the location of separators tested on multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and LLaMA-2 7B.",

Specifically, zero-shot CoT achieves remarkable improvements in a wide range of reasoning tasks by simply instructing the LLM with the prompt \"Let's think step by step!\". Despite the success of zero-shot CoT, the existing zero-shot prompting techniques remain limited to a single language, making it challenging to generalize to other languages and hindering global development. In this work, we introduce cross-lingual prompting (CLP), aiming to improve zero-shot CoT reasoning across languages. Specifically, CLP consists of two main components: (1) cross-lingual alignment prompting and (2) task-specific solver prompting. The cross-lingual alignment prompting is responsible for aligning representations across different languages, whereas the task-specific solver prompting is used to generate the final chain of thoughts and results for the reasoning task. In addition, we further introduce cross-lingual self-consistent prompting (CLSP) to ensemble different reasoning paths across languages. Our experimental evaluations on several benchmarks demonstrate that CLP and CLSP significantly outperform the existing prompting methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance. We hope this work will inspire further breakthroughs in cross-lingual CoT.",

However, existing research primarily focuses on improving performance, lacking a comprehensive framework to explain and understand the fundamental factors behind CoT's success. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel perspective grounded in the Hopfieldian view of cognition in cognitive neuroscience. We establish a connection between CoT reasoning and key cognitive elements such as stimuli, actions, neural populations, and representation spaces. From our view, we can understand the reasoning process as the movement between these representation spaces. Building on this insight, we develop a method for localizing reasoning errors in the response of CoTs. Moreover, we propose the Representation-of-Thought (RoT) framework, which leverages the robustness of low-dimensional representation spaces to enhance the robustness of the reasoning process in CoTs. Experimental results demonstrate that RoT improves the robustness and interpretability of CoT reasoning while offering fine-grained control over the reasoning process.",

Although logically sound reasoning appears inherently crucial for chain of thought, prior studies surprisingly reveal minimal impact when using invalid demonstrations instead. Furthermore, the conventional chain of thought does not inform language models on what mistakes to avoid, which potentially leads to more errors. Hence, inspired by how humans can learn from both positive and negative examples, we propose contrastive chain of thought to enhance language model reasoning. Compared to the conventional chain of thought, our approach provides both valid and invalid reasoning demonstrations, to guide the model to reason step-by-step while reducing reasoning mistakes. To improve generalization, we introduce an automatic method to construct contrastive demonstrations. Our experiments on reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that contrastive chain of thought can serve as a general enhancement of chain-of-thought prompting.",

In this paper, we propose leveraging reasoning patterns to enhance CoT prompting effectiveness. Reasoning patterns represent the process by which language models arrive at their final results. By utilizing prior knowledge and prompt-based methods from large models, we first construct task-specific pattern sets. We then select diverse demonstrations based on different reasoning patterns. This approach not only mitigates the impact of noise but also provides explicit interpretability to help us understand the mechanisms of CoT.

        "abstract": "We explore how generating a chain of thought -- a series of intermediate reasoning steps -- significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.",

We establish a theoretical foundation for this paradigm, formalizing MP as a functor that maps a category of tasks to a category of structured prompts, thereby guaranteeing that compositional problem-solving strategies can be systematically decomposed into modular prompt structures. We extend this concept to Recursive Meta Prompting (RMP), an automated process where an LLM can generate and refine its own prompts. We model this self-improvement loop formally as a monad, providing a principled framework for automated prompt engineering. Our claims are validated through extensive experiments demonstrating that a Qwen-72B base model, guided by a single, example-agnostic meta-prompt, achieves state-of-the-art results on MATH, GSM8K, and Game of 24.

Each state leverages a unique set of resources including prompts and (optionally) additional tools to augment the generation process. Our experimental results show that SCoT prompting with designated states for hallucination mitigation increases agent faithfulness to grounding documents by up to 16.8%. When used as training data, our open-domain conversations synthesized from only 6 Wikipedia-based seed demonstrations train strong conversational QA agents; in out-of-domain evaluation, for example, we observe improvements of up to 13.9% over target domain gold data when the latter is augmented with our generated examples.",

The reasoning capability is essential for large language models (LLMs) to serve as the brain of the artificial general intelligence agent. Recent studies reveal that fine-tuning LLMs on data with the chain of thought (COT) reasoning process can significantly enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, we find that the fine-tuned LLMs suffer from an \\textit{Assessment Misalignment} problem, i.e., they frequently assign higher scores to subpar COTs, leading to potential limitations in their reasoning abilities. To address this problem, we introduce an \\textit{Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT)} paradigm, which involves three steps: 1) fine-tuning LLMs with COT training data; 2) generating multiple COT responses for each question, and categorizing them into positive and negative ones based on whether they achieve the correct answer; 3) calibrating the scores of positive and negative responses given by LLMs with a ",

      "methodology": "Based on the provided excerpt, the research methodology of \"Making Large Language Models Better Reasoners with Alignment\" can be summarized as follows.\n\nThe study employs a three-step **Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT)** paradigm designed to rectify the identified **Assessment Misalignment** problem, where models fine-tuned with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data incorrectly assign higher likelihoods to subpar reasoning paths. The core design involves: 1) an initial **Vanilla Fine-Tuning (VFT)** of the LLM on CoT data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE); 2) a **data generation and categorization** phase where the fine-tuned model produces multiple candidate CoT responses per question, which are then labeled as positive (leading to the correct final answer) or negative (leading to an incorrect answer); and 3) a final **alignment calibration** step. This third step introduces a novel **constraint alignment loss** with dual objectives: an **Alignment** objective that ensures the model's score for positive responses exceeds that for negatives, and a **Constraint** objective that keeps negative response scores within a reasonable range to prevent model degradation. The authors also extend this framework to scenarios with **ranking feedback** (beyond binary) and conduct a comparative analysis of recent ranking-based alignment methods like DPO, RRHF, and PRO, arguing for the importance of the constraint component.\n\nRegarding data and analysis, the methodology relies on **generated synthetic data** from the model itself post-initial fine-tuning. For each question in the training set, the model samples multiple reasoning chains, and their quality is assessed **automatically** based on the veracity of the final answer (e.g., as shown in the excerpt, a CoT leading to \"$10\" is marked positive/✓). The primary **analysis techniques** are empirical evaluations across **four reasoning benchmarks** (specific datasets not named in the excerpt but typical in this domain include GSM8K, MATH, etc.). Performance is measured using task-specific **accuracy metrics**. The study further analyzes robustness through **multi-task** and **out-of-distribution** evaluations. Key **configurations** include the use of **open-source LLMs** as base models, the application of the constraint alignment loss with its balancing hyperparameters, and the comparative setup against baseline alignment methods (DPO, RRHF, PRO) from which the constraint mechanism is ablated to demonstrate its necessity.\n\nIn summary, the methodology centers on a post-hoc alignment procedure that uses model-generated, outcome-labeled reasoning paths to calibrate the LLM's internal assessment of reasoning quality via a specialized loss function, moving beyond standard supervised fine-tuning to improve discriminative reasoning capabilities.",

      "methodology": "This study employs a comparative experimental design to investigate a critical gap in the evaluation of reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The core approach is to first establish a baseline by fine-tuning a selection of models—three LLMs and one large vision-language model (LVLM)—using a representative policy gradient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, a dominant post-training technique. Subsequently, the authors systematically evaluate the resulting models not only on standard, idealized benchmarks but also under three novel, formally defined non-ideal scenarios: **summary inference** (requiring integration of multiple possibilities), **fine-grained noise suppression** (discerning subtle signal from noise), and **contextual filtering** (isolating relevant evidence from extensive information). This design allows for a direct comparison of model performance between ideal and non-ideal conditions after identical RL optimization.\n\nFor data collection and sources, the methodology leverages eight public datasets to ensure robustness and generalizability. While the specific datasets are not enumerated in the provided text, they are chosen to span the three challenging scenarios, moving beyond commonly used benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH. The models are trained and evaluated on this curated suite of tasks, which presumably includes both traditional reasoning benchmarks (to confirm baseline improvements) and newly constructed or adapted tasks that operationalize the non-ideal conditions. The data sources thus serve as the empirical ground for testing the central hypothesis that RL fine-tuning, while effective in ideal settings, fails to cultivate advanced reasoning abilities akin to human cognition.\n\nThe primary analysis technique is quantitative performance evaluation, comparing model outputs against ground-truth answers across the different scenarios. The key metric is the relative performance decline when transitioning from ideal to non-ideal conditions, despite the models having undergone the same RL-fine-tuning process.

The core methodological approach is the **Adaptive Reasoning Suppression (ARS) framework**, a decoding-manipulation method designed to dynamically truncate redundant reasoning chains. ARS is predicated on the \"overthinking phenomenon\" and operates by monitoring the model's internal certainty at multiple checkpoints during generation. Unlike static suppression methods, it introduces a **progressive threshold adaptation** mechanism, where the certainty threshold required to trigger suppression becomes stricter as reasoning progresses. This allows for more aggressive pruning of early redundancies while preserving later, potentially critical, verification steps. The study is explicitly comparative, benchmarking ARS against existing prompt-guided, training-based, and decoding-manipulation methods to demonstrate superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\n\nThe evaluation utilizes established **mathematical reasoning benchmarks** as the primary data sources, though specific dataset names are not enumerated in the provided text. The methodology implies the use of standard datasets common in LRM evaluation, which typically include problems from domains like grade-school math, algebra, and competition mathematics (e.g., GSM8K, MATH, or similar). The input data consists of reasoning queries (*q*), and the outputs are the models' generated reasoning chains and final answers. A key operational parameter is the imposition of a **maximum token limit of 1200 tokens per response** to constrain generation. The data for analysis is generated in situ by running the subject LRMs (such as architectures analogous to OpenAI’s o1/o3 or DeepSeek-R1) on these benchmarks under both standard and ARS-modified decoding regimes.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\n\nThe primary analysis technique is **quantitative performance benchmarking** using a suite of efficiency and accuracy metrics. Core **efficiency metrics** include **token reduction**, **latency reduction**, and **energy reduction**. Accuracy is assessed by comparing the final extracted answer (*f(o)*) against the ground truth (*y*), with the objective formalized as minimizing expected output length subject to an acceptable accuracy degradation threshold (*ϵ*). The **key technical parameters and configurations** of ARS itself involve: 1) The set of **reflection-triggering keywords** (*T*, e.g., \"Wait\", \"But\", \"Alternatively\") used to identify potential redundancy points; 2) The **multi-checkpoint certainty estimation** mechanism, which evaluates model confidence at several intervals rather than a single point; and 3) The **progressive suppression thresholds**, which are dynamically adjusted based on reasoning progression patterns. The methodology is described as \"training-free,\" meaning all analyses are conducted through inference-time interventions without fine-tuning the base model parameters.",

The framework is structured to translate high-level natural language research goals—such as \"find the strongest CO-binding site\"—into executable **density functional theory (DFT)** simulation workflows. The study's design systematically compares the efficiency of different reasoning strategies within this hierarchy: a **single-agent baseline** is evaluated against three distinct **multi-agent collaboration** protocols. These include a **peer-review** approach where agents critique proposals, a **triage-ranking** method for prioritizing candidates, and a **triage-forms** system that uses structured templates to standardize hypothesis generation and evaluation. The primary objective is to assess whether LLM-driven reasoning can significantly reduce the number of required, computationally expensive DFT calculations compared to naive or stochastic search methods.\n\nData generation and collection are intrinsically tied to the autonomous simulation pipeline. The primary data source is **first-principles quantum mechanical calculations** performed using DFT, which the MASTER framework autonomously designs, executes via a computational backend (presumably leveraging standard DFT codes like VASP or Quantum ESPRESSO), and interprets. The study validates the methodology across two specific chemical applications, which serve as the testbed datasets: 1) **CO adsorption on Cu-surface transition metal (M) adatoms** and 2) **CO adsorption on M–N–C catalysts**. The key metrics for evaluating the methodology's performance are **computational efficiency** (quantified as the reduction in the number of required atomistic simulations) and the **quality of reasoning**.

The basic idea of CoT is to let LLMs break down their thought processes step-by-step by putting exemplars in the input prompt. However, the densely structured prompt exemplars of CoT may cause the cognitive overload of LLMs. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce COT-SEP, a method that strategically employs separators at the end of each exemplar in CoT prompting. These separators are designed to help the LLMs understand their thought processes better while reasoning. Interestingly, it turns out that COT-SEP significantly improves the LLMs' performances on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K, AQuA, CSQA), compared with the vanilla CoT, which does not use separators.

The research is framed as an ablation study, where the performance of this modified prompt is directly compared against a baseline of vanilla CoT prompting (without separators) across multiple models and tasks. The central hypothesis is that these separators mitigate cognitive overload by chunking information, thereby enhancing the model's ability to parse and reason through the exemplar chain.\n\nFor evaluation, the authors utilize established reasoning benchmarks as their data sources. Specifically, they test on complex arithmetic reasoning tasks using the **GSM8K** and **AQuA** datasets, and on commonsense reasoning using the **CommonsenseQA (CSQA)** dataset.

The core approach is a two-stage prompting architecture. First, a **cross-lingual alignment prompting** component is applied to the non-English input query; its function is to align the semantic representations across languages, effectively preparing the model for reasoning in a multilingual context. Second, a **task-specific solver prompting** component generates the final English CoT and answer. This decoupled design explicitly separates the challenge of cross-lingual understanding from the task of step-by-step reasoning. Furthermore, the authors extend this framework with **Cross-lingual Self-Consistent Prompting (CLSP)**, an ensemble technique that aggregates multiple, potentially diverse reasoning paths generated from different linguistic prompts or paraphrases to arrive at a more robust final answer.\n\nThe methodology is evaluated using established multilingual reasoning benchmarks, specifically referencing the dataset introduced by Shi et al. (2022), which is the first multilingual dataset created to evaluate mathematical reasoning capabilities across languages. While not exhaustively listed in the provided excerpt, such benchmarks typically involve translating or adapting existing English reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K for arithmetic, CommonsenseQA for commonsense reasoning) into multiple languages. The primary **analysis technique** is quantitative performance comparison against strong baselines, including the standard zero-shot CoT prompt (\"Let's think step by step\") applied directly to non-English queries. The key **metric** for evaluation is reasoning accuracy on the target tasks, with the aim of demonstrating that CLP and CLSP achieve state-of-the-art performance by more effectively leveraging the model's inherent, but often language-isolated, reasoning capacities.\n\nKey **configurations and parameters** of the methodology revolve around the design and content of the two-stage prompts. The exact phrasing and structure of the cross-lingual alignment prompt are critical, as they must effectively guide the LLM to bridge the linguistic gap without performing the core reasoning itself. Similarly, the task-specific solver prompt must be generic enough to work for various reasoning types yet precise in its instruction to generate a coherent CoT. For CLSP, a key parameter is the number and variety of generated reasoning paths to ensemble, employing a majority-vote mechanism to determine the final answer. The entire protocol operates in a **zero-shot** manner, meaning no task-specific examples are provided in the prompt and no model parameters are fine-tuned, adhering to the in-context learning paradigm of large-scale LLMs.",

      "methodology": "This study adopts a theoretical and experimental methodology to analyze the reasoning processes in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting through a novel cognitive neuroscience lens. The core research design is a conceptual framework development, grounded in the **Hopfieldian view of cognition**, which posits that cognitive states can be understood as attractors in a dynamical system. The authors establish an analogical mapping between CoT reasoning and key cognitive elements: the initial query is treated as a *stimulus*, intermediate reasoning steps are *actions*, the model's layers are *neural populations*, and the latent spaces within these layers are *representation spaces*. This foundational perspective allows them to conceptualize reasoning not merely as a sequence of tokens but as a trajectory through these high-dimensional representation spaces. Building upon this theoretical model, the study proposes two applied contributions: a method for **localizing reasoning errors** within the CoT sequence and a novel **Representation-of-Thought (RoT) framework** designed to enhance reasoning robustness by leveraging the stability of low-dimensional projections of these representation spaces.\n\nFor empirical validation, the methodology employs standard benchmark datasets to evaluate the proposed RoT framework's performance and interpretability. Although the provided excerpt does not list specific datasets, typical benchmarks for such work include mathematical reasoning (e.g., **GSM8K**, **MATH**), commonsense reasoning (e.g., **CommonsenseQA**), and symbolic reasoning tasks. The analysis techniques are both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitatively, the study likely employs standard **accuracy** and **robustness metrics** (e.g., performance under adversarial perturbations or noisy inputs) to compare RoT against baseline CoT prompting. Qualitatively, the error localization method provides a mechanism for interpretability analysis, allowing the researchers to trace where in the representation space trajectory a reasoning failure occurs. The RoT framework itself constitutes a key analytical technique, intervening in the standard generation process by mapping hidden states to a lower-dimensional space, applying transformations (e.g., smoothing, correction), and then mapping back to influence subsequent token generation.\n\nThe key configurations and parameters central to this methodology revolve around the instantiation of the Hopfieldian analogy and the RoT framework. This includes defining the mapping from model layers (e.g., specific transformer blocks) to *neural populations* and identifying the relevant **hidden state vectors** that constitute the *representation space*. For the RoT framework, critical parameters involve the **dimensionality of the low-dimensional projection** (e.g., via PCA or other reduction techniques), the specific **transformation functions** applied in that space to \"correct\" the reasoning trajectory, and the **intervention points** in the CoT sequence where these representations are extracted and modified. The experimental setup would also require standard parameters such as the choice of **LLM backbone** (e.g., GPT, LLaMA series), **prompting templates**, and **generation hyperparameters** (temperature, top-p). Ultimately, the methodology integrates a cross-disciplinary theoretical model with applied algorithmic innovation and empirical benchmarking to explain and enhance the mechanistic underpinnings of CoT reasoning.",

Although logically sound reasoning appears inherently crucial for chain of thought, prior studies surprisingly reveal minimal impact when using invalid demonstrations instead. Furthermore, the conventional chain of thought does not inform language models on what mistakes to avoid, which potentially leads to more errors. Hence, inspired by how humans can learn from both positive and negative examples, we propose contrastive chain of thought to enhance language model reasoning. Compared to the conventional chain of thought, our approach provides both valid and invalid reasoning demonstrations, to guide the model to reason step-by-step while reducing reasoning mistakes.

      "methodology": "**Study Design and Approach**\n\nThe research employs a comparative experimental design to evaluate the proposed **Contrastive Chain-of-Thought (Contrastive CoT)** prompting method against the conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline. The core approach is inspired by human learning from both positive and negative examples. The methodology is structured in two main phases: a preliminary ablation study and a main evaluation. The preliminary study systematically investigates the impact of different types of invalid reasoning demonstrations to answer whether they can enhance CoT, moving beyond prior findings that showed minimal effect from invalid examples alone. Based on insights from this analysis, the authors propose Contrastive CoT, which provides language models with demonstrations containing both a valid reasoning chain (positive example) and an automatically generated invalid chain (negative example) for the same question. The method is designed to be task-agnostic and is evaluated for its compatibility with advanced inference techniques like self-consistency.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\n\nThe study utilizes established public benchmarks for evaluating complex reasoning in language models. Specifically, the main quantitative evaluations are conducted on **GSM-8K** (a dataset of grade-school math word problems) and **Bamboogle** (a multi-hop question-answering dataset requiring Google searches). These datasets were chosen for their complexity and the necessity for multi-step reasoning. The demonstrations (both positive and negative) used for prompting are not sourced from new annotations but are instead generated automatically from existing valid reasoning chains. The authors analyze \"multiple invalid reasoning types\" to design a method that corrupts these valid chains, thereby creating the required contrastive negative examples. The primary model for evaluation is **GPT-3.5-Turbo**, a widely used large language model (LLM), ensuring the findings are relevant to a common application setting.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\n\nThe analysis is primarily quantitative, comparing the final answer accuracy of Contrastive CoT against standard CoT prompting on the selected benchmarks. The key metric is the point improvement in accuracy, reported as **9.8** and **16.0** points for GSM-8K and Bamboogle, respectively. Additionally, the authors perform a qualitative error analysis by examining the generated reasoning chains to measure the reduction in errors within intermediate steps, which speaks to the method's secondary goal of improving reasoning trustworthiness. The key methodological configurations involve the design of the contrastive demonstrations themselves. The preliminary study likely varied parameters such as the type of reasoning error introduced (e.g., logical fallacies, arithmetic mistakes, irrelevant steps) to determine which forms of negative examples are most beneficial. The final proposed method encapsulates these findings into an automated procedure for constructing the contrastive prompt, which is then applied uniformly across diverse tasks in the main evaluation.",

The core design involves a two-stage approach: first, the **construction of task-specific reasoning pattern sets**, and second, the **diverse selection of demonstrations** based on these patterns. Reasoning patterns are defined as the structured process by which a language model derives an answer, representing the underlying logical or algorithmic template. The authors posit that by categorizing and selecting exemplars according to these intrinsic reasoning structures—rather than surface-level question semantics—the resulting demonstrations provide a more precise and interpretable contextual guide. This approach is positioned as a more robust alternative to existing methods that often introduce semantic noise, thereby failing to adequately activate the model's domain-specific reasoning capabilities.\n\nFor data collection and pattern construction, the methodology leverages **prior knowledge and prompt-based methods from large models** themselves. While specific datasets are not enumerated in the provided text, the paper references standard reasoning benchmarks, implying the use of established corpora for tasks like logical reasoning, mathematical computation, and symbolic reasoning. The process likely involves using a powerful LLM to analyze a pool of candidate CoT examples, abstracting their step-by-step solutions into canonical reasoning templates or patterns. These patterns form a curated set that serves as the basis for subsequent demonstration selection. The selection strategy emphasizes **diversity across reasoning patterns** to ensure the final few-shot prompt covers a broad spectrum of logical approaches applicable to the target task.\n\nThe analysis techniques are primarily empirical and comparative, centered on **extensive experiments across various reasoning tasks**. The key metric for evaluation is the downstream task performance (e.g., accuracy) of LLMs when prompted with the pattern-based demonstrations versus other unsupervised CoT selection baselines. Robustness is a critical measured property, assessed by the consistency of improvements across different tasks and potentially different model scales. A significant analytical contribution is the provision of **explicit interpretability**; by organizing demonstrations by pattern, the method offers a transparent lens into which logical mechanisms the CoT prompt is designed to trigger, allowing researchers to understand and diagnose the reasoning process more clearly than with semantically selected examples. Key configurations would include the methodology for pattern extraction (e.g., the prompting strategy for the curator model), the criteria for defining pattern diversity, and the number of demonstrations selected per pattern to compose the final prompt.",

      "methodology": "**Study Design and Approach**\n\nThe research employs an experimental study design centered on a novel prompting technique termed *chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting*. The core approach is a variant of few-shot in-context learning, where a large language model (LLM) is prompted with a fixed set of input-output exemplars before being presented with a new query. The key innovation is that these exemplars do not merely present the question and final answer; instead, they include a step-by-step natural language rationale—the \"chain of thought\"—that demonstrates the reasoning process leading to the answer. This methodology is positioned as a more efficient alternative to rationale-augmented training or fine-tuning, which requires costly, large-scale collections of labeled reasoning steps. The study tests this approach across a suite of benchmark tasks requiring arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning to evaluate its generality and effectiveness in eliciting latent reasoning capabilities in LLMs.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\n\nThe study does not involve the collection of new training data, as it leverages the existing pretrained knowledge of the models. Instead, it utilizes established public benchmarks as its primary data sources for evaluation. The paper explicitly highlights the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems as a key dataset, where CoT prompting is shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. While not exhaustively listed in the provided excerpt, the full paper evaluates on a range of such tasks. The \"data\" for the prompting intervention itself consists of a small number of handcrafted exemplars (e.g., eight for GSM8K). These exemplars are carefully constructed to include high-quality, natural language reasoning chains that serve as demonstrations for the model during inference.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\n\nThe primary analysis technique is quantitative performance comparison using task-specific accuracy metrics. The results are analyzed by comparing the performance of standard few-shot prompting against chain-of-thought prompting across different model scales. A critical analytical focus is on *emergent abilities*, investigating how the benefits of CoT prompting scale with model size, with the implication that the technique is particularly effective for \"sufficiently large\" models like the 540B-parameter PaLM featured in the study. Key experimental configurations include the selection and number of in-context exemplars, the design of the chain-of-thought sequences within them, and the use of very large-scale models (e.g., PaLM 540B) as the primary testbed. The outcome is measured against strong baselines, including prior state-of-the-art results from fine-tuned models like GPT-3 175B with a verifier, thereby establishing the potency of the in-context CoT method.",

    "review_text": "**Title: Advancing the Frontiers of Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Narrative Review of Recent Paradigms, Challenges, and Opportunities**\n\n**1. INTRODUCTION**\n\nThe capacity for robust, reliable, and efficient reasoning represents a critical frontier in the development of large language models (LLMs). While models have demonstrated impressive performance on structured reasoning benchmarks, recent research has shifted focus from merely scaling performance metrics to understanding and improving the fundamental *nature* of LLM reasoning. This review synthesizes the latest advances in LLM reasoning, addressing the central question: *What are the latest conceptual and technical advances aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs?* The significance of this inquiry lies in moving beyond benchmark-centric progress to develop models that reason in ways that are correct, efficient, robust to real-world imperfections, and aligned with human evaluative judgment. This narrative review is structured around five emergent themes: (1) Alignment and Fine-Tuning for Improved Reasoning, (2) Efficiency Optimization at Inference Time, (3) Benchmarking Beyond Ideal Conditions, (4) Dynamic and Adaptive Reasoning Control, and (5) the Identification of Novel Failure Modes. Through a synthesis of recent preprints and publications, this review aims to chart the current landscape, critically evaluate methodological trends, identify persistent gaps, and propose directions for future research.\n\n**2. THEMATIC ANALYSIS**\n\n**Alignment and Fine-Tuning for Improved Reasoning**\nA prominent line of inquiry investigates how post-training alignment and fine-tuning shape reasoning capabilities. A critical finding is that standard fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data can introduce a pathology termed \"Assessment Misalignment,\" where models learn to generate reasoning steps but lose the ability to correctly evaluate them, often assigning higher likelihoods to incorrect paths than correct ones [Making Large Language Models Better Reasoners with Alignment, 2023]. This decoupling of generation from evaluation motivates novel alignment paradigms. The proposed Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT) addresses this by incorporating a constraint alignment loss that explicitly enforces proper scoring order while preventing model degradation, demonstrating improvements across reasoning benchmarks [Making Large Language Models Better Reasoners with Alignment, 2023]. Notably, this work posits that the 'constraint' component is a crucial, overlooked element in popular ranking-based alignment methods like DPO, suggesting a unifying insight for the alignment community.\n\nHowever, the relationship between alignment and reasoning robustness is complex and non-monotonic. Counter-intuitively, Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning—while boosting performance on pristine, ideal-condition benchmarks—can systematically *degrade* reasoning under realistic, \"non-ideal\" conditions such as tasks requiring summary inference or noise suppression [Large Language Models Reasoning Abilities Under Non-Ideal Conditions After RL-Fine-Tuning, 2025]. This presents a significant tension: methods that align models to produce correct answers on clean data may inadvertently make them more fragile, exposing a fundamental challenge in creating generally robust reasoners. The contrast between these findings highlights a central debate: whether alignment should primarily optimize for target output distributions (potentially at the cost of robustness) or must explicitly incorporate robustness to input perturbations and inferential demands into its objective.\n\n**Efficiency Optimization for Reasoning at Inference Time**\nAs reasoning models grow more capable, their computational cost—manifest in long reasoning chains, high latency, and energy consumption—has spurred research into inference-time efficiency. The dominant approach is training-free, dynamic intervention. A seminal method is Adaptive Reasoning Suppression (ARS), which uses a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism to monitor confidence during generation and truncate redundant steps, achieving reductions of over 50% in token usage and energy while maintaining accuracy on mathematical reasoning tasks [ARS: Adaptive Reasoning Suppression for Efficient Large Reasoning Language Models, 2025]. This approach moves beyond static early-exit strategies by incorporating an adaptive threshold that responds to perceived query difficulty and confidence trends.\n\nThese efficiency-focused methods share a common philosophy: treating the reasoning chain not as a fixed, obligatory process but as a dynamic sequence where computation should be allocated prudently. They operate on the principle that once a model has reached a sufficient level of internal certainty, further elaboration is wasteful. However, this raises inherent trade-offs. While ARS provides theoretical guarantees bounding output length relative to an optimal path, the practical risk lies in premature suppression, where a model’s confidence may be miscalibrated, leading to the truncation of necessary but non-monotonic reasoning steps. The focus on mathematical benchmarks, where solution verification is often more straightforward, may obscure these risks in domains like commonsense or legal reasoning, where justification is as critical as the answer.\n\n**Benchmarking and Evaluation Beyond Ideal Conditions**\nClosely linked to the findings on RL-fine-tuning fragility is a growing critique of standard evaluation paradigms. A compelling argument posits that the field has overstated LLM reasoning abilities by relying on idealized, noise-free benchmarks [Large Language Models Reasoning Abilities Under Non-Ideal Conditions After RL-Fine-Tuning, 2025]. This has catalyzed a push for neuroscientifically-inspired evaluation that tests reasoning under conditions where human cognition remains robust but models may fail. Key proposed scenarios include summary inference (deriving conclusions from summaries), fine-grained noise suppression (ignoring irrelevant details), and contextual filtering (extracting salient information from complex narratives).\n\nThis theme represents a paradigm shift from evaluating *performance* to evaluating *robustness and reliability*. It challenges the assumption that improvements on sanitized benchmarks translate to real-world utility. The consistent deficits exposed in aligned models under these non-ideal conditions suggest that current training data and objectives do not adequately simulate the inferential challenges of practical application. This new evaluation philosophy does not merely add new datasets but reframes the goal of reasoning research: the objective is not a model that can solve a curated problem, but one that can maintain reliable reasoning processes in the face of ambiguity, redundancy, and imperfect information.\n\n**Dynamic and Adaptive Reasoning Control**\nUnderpinning both efficiency methods and robust reasoning is the theme of dynamic control, where models self-regulate their reasoning process. ARS’s multi-checkpoint monitoring is a prime example, enabling the model to act as its own meta-cognitive monitor [ARS: Adaptive Reasoning Suppression for Efficient Large Reasoning Language Models, 2025]. This moves reasoning from a passive, feedforward generation into an active process with feedback loops. The adaptive threshold mechanism, which adjusts suppression intensity based on initial query analysis and ongoing confidence trends, exemplifies a move towards context-aware reasoning control.\n\nThis theme connects to broader ambitions in AI for developing models with self-reflective capabilities. The technical focus on confidence estimation and adaptive decision-making during generation is a pragmatic step towards models that \"think about their thinking.\" However, current implementations rely heavily on heuristics (e.g., checkpoint frequency, threshold formulas) and proxy signals (e.g., token probabilities) that may not fully capture conceptual certainty. The challenge is to develop control mechanisms that are as nuanced and reliable as the reasoning they are meant to regulate.\n\n**Identification of Novel Failure Modes in Trained Models**\nAdvancing the field requires not just building new capabilities but also meticulously diagnosing failures. Recent work excels at identifying specific, previously under-explored pathologies. \"Assessment Misalignment\" is a paradigmatic example of a failure mode *induced* by a specific training regimen (CoT fine-tuning) [Making Large Language Models Better Reasoners with Alignment, 2023]. Similarly, the work on non-ideal conditions identifies a systematic fragility introduced by RL fine-tuning, revealing that a model can become simultaneously more capable on standard tasks and more brittle on related but realistic ones [Large Language Models Reasoning Abilities Under Non-Ideal Conditions After RL-Fine-Tuning, 2025].\n\nThese diagnostic studies serve as crucial counterweights to purely performance-driven research. They demonstrate that aggregate metric improvements can mask significant, structured vulnerabilities. This theme emphasizes that understanding *how and why* models fail under specific conditions is as valuable as documenting their successes. It shifts the research question from \"How can we improve the score?\" to \"What are the boundary conditions of current reasoning abilities, and what architectural or training limitations do they reveal?\"\n\n**3. CRITICAL DISCUSSION**\n\nA clear pattern across the literature is the movement from monolithic evaluation—often centered on accuracy on a narrow set of tasks—towards a multi-dimensional assessment of reasoning encompassing correctness, efficiency, robustness, and self-awareness. The findings reveal significant tensions between these dimensions. For instance, alignment techniques that improve correctness on benchmarks can compromise robustness [Large Language Models Reasoning Abilities Under Non-Ideal Conditions After RL-Fine-Tuning, 2025], while inference-time interventions that boost efficiency rely on confidence metrics that may themselves be misaligned [Making Large Language Models Better Reasoners with Alignment, 2023]. This suggests that future progress requires holistic optimization frameworks that consider these trade-offs explicitly.\n\nMethodologically, the field heavily relies on empirical, benchmark-driven experimentation. While this provides concrete evidence, it also introduces limitations. First, there is a pronounced concentration on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, MATH). The external validity of findings for more open-ended, domain-specific, or multimodal reasoning is often assumed rather than demonstrated. Second, many studies, including several discussed here, are presented as preprints, meaning their methodological rigor and claims await full peer review. Third, explanations for observed phenomena—*why* RL fine-tuning harms robustness or *how* assessment misalignment arises in parameter space—are largely speculative. The research is strong at identifying correlations and effects but weaker at providing mechanistic, theoretical explanations grounded in the dynamics of model optimization or representation learning.\n\nFurthermore, the pursuit of efficiency via dynamic suppression, while promising, opens new methodological questions about evaluation. Shortening a reasoning chain changes the observable process, making it harder to diagnose *why* an answer was reached. This could obscure errors in reasoning that are bypassed rather than corrected, potentially reducing transparency and trustworthiness. The field must develop standards for evaluating not just the final output of an efficient reasoner, but the reliability and coherence of its truncated process.\n\n**4. GAPS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS**\n\nSeveral critical research gaps emerge from this synthesis. First, there is a **lack of mechanistic understanding** of why alignment techniques can degrade robustness. Future work should move beyond observational studies to develop testable hypotheses about how RL fine-tuning or CoT data affect internal representations and attention patterns, making models susceptible to specific noise types. Second, there is **narrow domain validation** for both efficiency and robustness methods. Research must expand evaluation to complex, real-world domains like scientific literature review, legal analysis, and commonsense planning, where reasoning structure is less formulaic. Third, the **long-term effects and trade-offs of inference-time interventions** are understudied. Research is needed on how adaptive suppression affects error propagation in long chains, model calibration, and the ability to recover from initial missteps. Finally, there is an **absence of holistic evaluation frameworks**. The community would benefit from integrated benchmarks that simultaneously measure accuracy, efficiency (token/latency), and robustness to non-ideal conditions, encouraging the development of models that excel across all dimensions.\n\nFuture directions should include: 1) Developing alignment objectives that explicitly incorporate robustness penalties for non-ideal scenarios; 2) Creating \"process-oriented\" evaluation suites that assess reasoning coherence and certainty calibration, not just answer correctness; 3) Exploring hybrid methods that combine robust alignment training with adaptive inference control; and 4) Conducting fundamental research on the representational correlates of reliable reasoning to guide architectural innovations.\n\n**5. CONCLUSION**\n\nThe latest advances in LLM reasoning reveal a field in maturation, moving beyond the pursuit of benchmark scores to a deeper interrogation of how models reason, when they fail, and at what cost. Key insights include the identification of novel failure modes like assessment misalignment and RL-induced fragility, the development of training-free methods for dynamic efficiency gains, and the compelling argument for a new evaluation paradigm centered on robustness under non-ideal conditions. The overarching significance of these findings is the recognition that true reasoning capability is a multi-faceted construct encompassing correctness, efficiency, stability, and self-awareness. The tensions between these facets—where gains in one can lead to regressions in another—highlight the complexity of the challenge. Future progress will depend on the community's ability to integrate these perspectives, develop more comprehensive theoretical models, and create evaluation frameworks that reflect the multifaceted demands of reasoning in the real world.",
