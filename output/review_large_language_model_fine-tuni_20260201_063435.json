        "abstract": "Instruction tuning significantly enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, the procedure to optimizing the mixing of instruction datasets for LLM fine-tuning is still poorly understood. This study categorizes instructions into three primary types: NLP downstream tasks, coding, and general chat. We explore the effects of instruction tuning on different combinations of datasets on LLM performance, and find that certain instruction types are more advantageous for specific applications but can negatively impact other areas. This work provides insights into instruction mixtures, laying the foundations for future research.",

        "abstract": "We give simpler, sparser, and faster algorithms for differentially private fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained language models, which achieve the state-of-the-art privacy versus utility tradeoffs on many standard NLP tasks. We propose a meta-framework for this problem, inspired by the recent success of highly parameter-efficient methods for fine-tuning. Our experiments show that differentially private adaptations of these approaches outperform previous private algorithms in three important dimensions: utility, privacy, and the computational and memory cost of private training. On many commonly studied datasets, the utility of private models approaches that of non-private models. For example, on the MNLI dataset we achieve an accuracy of $87.8\\%$ using RoBERTa-Large and $83.5\\%$ using RoBERTa-Base with a privacy budget of $ε= 6.7$. In comparison, absent privacy constraints, RoBERTa-Large achieves an accuracy of $90.2\\%$. Our findings are similar for natural language generation tasks. Privately fine-tuning with DART, GPT-2-Small, GPT-2-Medium, GPT-2-Large, and GPT-2-XL achieve BLEU scores of 38.5, 42.0, 43.1, and 43.8 respectively (privacy budget of $ε= 6.8,δ=$ 1e-5) whereas the non-private baseline is $48.1$. All our experiments suggest that larger models are better suited for private fine-tuning: while they are well known to achieve superior accuracy non-privately, we find that they also better maintain their accuracy when privacy is introduced.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved success in acting as agents, which interact with environments through tools such as search engines. However, LLMs are optimized for language generation instead of tool use during training or alignment, limiting their effectiveness as agents. To resolve this problem, previous work has first collected interaction trajectories between LLMs and environments, using only trajectories that successfully finished the task to fine-tune smaller models, making fine-tuning data scarce and acquiring it both difficult and costly. Discarding failed trajectories also leads to significant wastage of data and resources and limits the possible optimization paths during fine-tuning. In this paper, we argue that unsuccessful trajectories offer valuable insights, and LLMs can learn from these trajectories through appropriate quality control and fine-tuning strategies. By simply adding a prefix or suffix that tells the model whether to generate a successful trajectory during training, we improve model performance by a large margin on mathematical reasoning, multi-hop question answering, and strategic question answering tasks. We further analyze the inference results and find that our method provides a better trade-off between valuable information and errors in unsuccessful trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the value of negative trajectories and their application in agent-tunning scenarios. Our findings offer guidance for developing better agent-tuning methods and low-resource data usage techniques.",

        "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) with open-domain instruction following data brings colossal success. However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Human evaluations on a complexity-balanced test bed and Vicuna's testset show that instructions from Evol-Instruct are superior to human-created ones. By analyzing the human evaluation results of the high complexity part, we demonstrate that outputs from our WizardLM are preferred to outputs from OpenAI ChatGPT. In GPT-4 automatic evaluation, WizardLM achieves more than 90\\% capacity of ChatGPT on 17 out of 29 skills. Even though WizardLM still lags behind ChatGPT in some aspects, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with AI-evolved instructions is a promising direction for enhancing LLMs. Our code and data are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM",

        "abstract": "It is impossible today to pretend that the practice of machine learning is always compatible with the idea that training and testing data follow the same distribution. Several authors have recently used ensemble techniques to show how scenarios involving multiple data distributions are best served by representations that are both richer than those obtained by regularizing for the best in-distribution performance, and richer than those obtained under the influence of the implicit sparsity bias of common stochastic gradient procedures.\n  This contribution investigates the use of very high dropout rates instead of ensembles to obtain such rich representations. Although training a deep network from scratch using such dropout rates is virtually impossible, fine-tuning a large pre-trained model under such conditions is not only possible but also achieves out-of-distribution performances that exceed those of both ensembles and weight averaging methods such as model soups.\n  This result has practical significance because the importance of the fine-tuning scenario has considerably grown in recent years. This result also provides interesting insights on the nature of rich representations and on the intrinsically linear nature of fine-tuning a large network using a comparatively small dataset.",

However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic, non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM) using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios.

        "abstract": "The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since large language models (LLMs) first appeared. Yet, their massive memory consumption has become a significant roadblock to large-scale training. For instance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full parameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to high-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not reach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freezes most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over 10%-35% in terms of MT-Bench score while achieving on-par or better performance in MMLU, AGIEval and WinoGrande. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA surpasses LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.",

A large gap exists between LLMs' pass-at-one and pass-at-N performance in solving math problems, suggesting LLMs might be close to finding correct solutions, motivating our exploration of fine-tuning methods to unlock LLMs' performance. Using the challenging MATH dataset, we investigate three fine-tuning strategies: (1) solution fine-tuning, where we fine-tune to generate a detailed solution for a given math problem; (2) solution-cluster re-ranking, where the LLM is fine-tuned as a solution verifier/evaluator to choose among generated candidate solution clusters; (3) multi-task sequential fine-tuning, which integrates both solution generation and evaluation tasks together efficiently to enhance the LLM performance. With these methods, we present a thorough empirical study on a series of PaLM 2 models and find: (1) The quality and style of the step-by-step solutions used for fine-tuning can make a significant impact on the model performance; (2) While solution re-ranking and majority voting are both effective for improving the model performance when used separately, they can also be used together for an even greater performance boost; (3) Multi-task fine-tuning that sequentially separates the solution generation and evaluation tasks can offer improved performance compared with the solution fine-tuning baseline. Guided by these insights, we design a fine-tuning recipe that yields approximately 58.8% accuracy on the MATH dataset with fine-tuned PaLM 2-L models, an 11.2% accuracy improvement over the few-shot performance of pre-trained PaLM 2-L model with majority voting.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse distributions and tasks, largely due to extensive pre-training datasets. Fine-tuning MLLM has become a common practice to improve performance on specific downstream tasks. However, during fine-tuning, MLLM often faces the risk of forgetting knowledge acquired during pre-training, which can result in a decline in generalization abilities. To balance the trade-off between generalization and specialization, we propose measuring the parameter importance for both pre-trained and fine-tuning distributions, based on frozen pre-trained weight magnitude and accumulated fine-tuning gradient values. We further apply an importance-aware weight allocation strategy, selectively updating relatively important parameters for downstream tasks. We conduct empirical evaluations on both image captioning and visual question-answering tasks using various MLLM architectures. The comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solution, highlighting the efficiency of the crucial modules in enhancing downstream specialization performance while mitigating generalization degradation in MLLM Fine-Tuning.",

Despite the success, fine-tuning continues to rely on repeated and lengthy prompts, which escalate computational expenses, require more resources, and lead to slower inference. In this paper, we present a novel approach, PromptIntern, which internalizes prompt knowledge during model fine-tuning to achieve efficient inference and save costs. Instead of compressing the prompts for a vanilla model, PromptIntern aims to embed the recurrent prompt directly into the model parameters. We design a fine-tuning pipeline that includes instruction template compression, few-shot example absorption, and a progressive internalization strategy, effectively diminishing the need for intricate prompts during inference. Comprehensive experiments on challenging NL2Code tasks demonstrate that our method reduces input tokens by more than 90%, accelerates inference by 4.2 times, and reduces monetary inference costs by 88.3%.",

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on downstream tasks has become the de-facto learning paradigm in NLP. However, conventional approaches fine-tune all the parameters of the pre-trained model, which becomes prohibitive as the model size and the number of tasks grow. Recent work has proposed a variety of parameter-efficient transfer learning methods that only fine-tune a small number of (extra) parameters to attain strong performance. While effective, the critical ingredients for success and the connections among the various methods are poorly understood. In this paper, we break down the design of state-of-the-art parameter-efficient transfer learning methods and present a unified framework that establishes connections between them. Specifically, we re-frame them as modifications to specific hidden states in pre-trained models, and define a set of design dimensions along which different methods vary, such as the function to compute the modification and the position to apply the modification. Through comprehensive empirical studies across machine translation, text summarization, language understanding, and text classification benchmarks, we utilize the unified view to identify important design choices in previous methods. Furthermore, our unified framework enables the transfer of design elements across different approaches, and as a result we are able to instantiate new parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that tune less parameters than previous methods while being more effective, achieving comparable results to fine-tuning all parameters on all four tasks.",

To minimize the adaption cost for downstream tasks, many Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques are proposed for language and 2D image pre-trained models. However, the specialized PEFT method for 3D pre-trained models is still under-explored. To this end, we introduce Point-PEFT, a novel framework for adapting point cloud pre-trained models with minimal learnable parameters. Specifically, for a pre-trained 3D model, we freeze most of its parameters, and only tune the newly added PEFT modules on downstream tasks, which consist of a Point-prior Prompt and a Geometry-aware Adapter. The Point-prior Prompt adopts a set of learnable prompt tokens, for which we propose to construct a memory bank with domain-specific knowledge, and utilize a parameter-free attention to enhance the prompt tokens. The Geometry-aware Adapter aims to aggregate point cloud features within spatial neighborhoods to capture fine-grained geometric information through local interactions. Extensive experiments indicate that our Point-PEFT can achieve better performance than the full fine-tuning on various downstream tasks, while using only 5% of the trainable parameters, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

However, the scaling up of large foundation models has led to soaring costs in fine-tuning and parameter storage, rendering extensive adaptations impractical. This challenge has sparked the development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on optimizing a select subset of parameters while keeping the rest fixed, significantly lowering computational and storage overheads. While recent years have witnessed a significant success in PEFT, a deep understanding of the fundamental principles behind these methods remains unexplored. To this end, here we take the first step to unify all approaches by dissecting them from a decomposition perspective. We initiate a comprehensive mathematical analysis of these methods, allowing us to delve deeply into their underlying mechanisms, and we explore the reasons behind the variations in performance among different techniques. Furthermore, inspired by our theoretical analysis, we introduce two novel PEFT methods alongside a simple yet effective framework designed to enhance the performance of PEFT techniques across various applications. Our empirical validations, conducted across multiple datasets, demonstrate the efficacy of these methods, showcasing both theoretical validity and practical performance improvements under the guidance of our analytical findings. We believe our work will deepen researchers' understanding of PEFT and other techniques, prompting further contemplation and advancing the research across the whole community.",

        "abstract": "The goal of few-shot learning is to learn a classifier that can recognize unseen classes from limited support data with labels. A common practice for this task is to train a model on the base set first and then transfer to novel classes through fine-tuning (Here fine-tuning procedure is defined as transferring knowledge from base to novel data, i.e. learning to transfer in few-shot scenario.) or meta-learning. However, as the base classes have no overlap to the novel set, simply transferring whole knowledge from base data is not an optimal solution since some knowledge in the base model may be biased or even harmful to the novel class. In this paper, we propose to transfer partial knowledge by freezing or fine-tuning particular layer(s) in the base model. Specifically, layers will be imposed different learning rates if they are chosen to be fine-tuned, to control the extent of preserved transferability. To determine which layers to be recast and what values of learning rates for them, we introduce an evolutionary search based method that is efficient to simultaneously locate the target layers and determine their individual learning rates. We conduct extensive experiments on CUB and mini-ImageNet to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both meta-learning and non-meta based frameworks. Furthermore, we extend our method to the conventional pre-training + fine-tuning paradigm and obtain consistent improvement.",

Both challenges lead to issues such as poor generalizability, hallucination, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we construct Vision-Flan, the most diverse publicly available visual instruction tuning dataset to date, comprising 187 diverse tasks and 1,664,261 instances sourced from academic datasets, and each task is accompanied by an expert-written instruction. In addition, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning framework, in which VLMs are firstly finetuned on Vision-Flan and further tuned on GPT-4 synthesized data. We find this two-stage tuning framework significantly outperforms the traditional single-stage visual instruction tuning framework and achieves the state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of multi-modal evaluation benchmarks. Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to understand visual instruction tuning and our findings reveal that: (1) GPT-4 synthesized data does not substantially enhance VLMs' capabilities but rather modulates the model's responses to human-preferred formats; (2) A minimal quantity (e.g., 1,000) of GPT-4 synthesized data can effectively align VLM responses with human-preference; (3) Visual instruction tuning mainly helps large-language models (LLMs) to understand visual features.",

        "abstract": "Hyperparameters are a critical factor in reliably training well-performing reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Unfortunately, developing and evaluating automated approaches for tuning such hyperparameters is both costly and time-consuming. As a result, such approaches are often only evaluated on a single domain or algorithm, making comparisons difficult and limiting insights into their generalizability. We propose ARLBench, a benchmark for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in RL that allows comparisons of diverse HPO approaches while being highly efficient in evaluation. To enable research into HPO in RL, even in settings with low compute resources, we select a representative subset of HPO tasks spanning a variety of algorithm and environment combinations. This selection allows for generating a performance profile of an automated RL (AutoRL) method using only a fraction of the compute previously necessary, enabling a broader range of researchers to work on HPO in RL. With the extensive and large-scale dataset on hyperparameter landscapes that our selection is based on, ARLBench is an efficient, flexible, and future-oriented foundation for research on AutoRL. Both the benchmark and the dataset are available at https://github.com/automl/arlbench.",

It is desirable that these agents adjust to people's preferences, learn faster thanks to their help, and act safely around them. We argue that most current approaches that learn from human feedback are unsafe: rewarding or punishing the agent a-posteriori cannot immediately prevent it from wrong-doing. In this paper, we extend Policy Gradient to make it robust to external directives, that would otherwise break the fundamentally on-policy nature of Policy Gradient. Our technique, Directed Policy Gradient (DPG), allows a teacher or backup policy to override the agent before it acts undesirably, while allowing the agent to leverage human advice or directives to learn faster. Our experiments demonstrate that DPG makes the agent learn much faster than reward-based approaches, while requiring an order of magnitude less advice.",

      "abstract": "The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since large language models (LLMs) first appeared. Yet, their massive memory consumption has become a significant roadblock to large-scale training. For instance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full parameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to high-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not reach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is dis",

      ],
      "methodology": "**Study Design and Approach**\n\nThe research employs an empirical, hypothesis-driven methodology to develop a novel fine-tuning algorithm. The core approach is a two-phase study: first, a diagnostic analysis to identify a key behavioral difference between Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and full-parameter fine-tuning, and second, the design of a new method that leverages this insight. The diagnostic phase is observational, comparing the layer-wise evolution of weight norms during training across both paradigms. The intervention phase is algorithmic, introducing Layerwise Importance Sampling for AdamW (LISA), which strategically freezes and unfreezes network layers during training based on a sampling distribution derived from the LoRA observations. This design aims to emulate LoRA’s purported efficiency in prioritizing updates to critical layers (embeddings and output head) while avoiding its low-rank representational limitations by performing full-parameter updates on a stochastically selected subset of layers.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\n\nThe empirical analysis relies on internal metrics collected during controlled training runs rather than on external benchmark datasets for final performance. The primary data source is the **Alpaca-GPT4 dataset**, used for fine-tuning the models under observation. The key collected metric is the **mean weight norm per layer**, defined as (1/T) * Σ_t ||θ_t^(ℓ)||_2, calculated over training steps *t* for each layer *ℓ*. This data is collected for both full-parameter fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning across two model architectures: **GPT-2** and **LLaMA-2-7B**. The visualization of this layer-wise metric (Figure 2) serves as the foundational evidence for the observed discrepancy in update patterns, which directly informs the LISA algorithm's design.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\n\nThe analysis is primarily comparative and visual, contrasting the trajectories of layer-wise weight norms between the two training methods to identify systematic patterns. The key finding—that LoRA produces disproportionately large weight norms in the embedding and language modeling head layers compared to intermediate layers—is used to derive a sampling probability. The core technique adapted is **importance sampling**, where the probability *p^(ℓ)* of unfreezing a layer is set proportional to the ratio of its weight norm under LoRA to its weight norm under full-parameter tuning. In practice, this is simplified to a configuration where only the embedding and output head are always trainable, while *γ* intermediate layers are randomly unfrozen per sampling period. **Key configurable parameters** include the number of sampled layers *γ*, which controls memory usage and update sparsity; the sampling period *K* (iterations between re-sampling); and the standard AdamW hyperparameters like the initial learning rate *η_0*. The method is evaluated in subsequent sections (referenced, e.g., in image generation tasks in Appendix A.1) to compare its efficiency and performance against LoRA and full fine-tuning.",

      "methodology": "This study employs a multi-strategy experimental design to investigate how fine-tuning methodologies can enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The core approach is structured around three sequential and complementary fine-tuning strategies, systematically evaluated on the challenging MATH dataset. The first strategy, **Supervised Step-by-Step Solution Fine-Tuning (SSFT)**, serves as a baseline, training the model to generate detailed, step-by-step solutions. Building upon this, the second strategy, **Solution-Cluster Re-ranking (SCR)**, fine-tunes the model as a solution verifier to evaluate and rank multiple candidate solution clusters, aiming to improve discriminative ability. The third and most integrated strategy, **Multi-task Sequential Fine-tuning**, efficiently combines solution generation and evaluation tasks within a single training regimen. The study design is explicitly comparative, assessing the individual and combined efficacy of these methods against a strong pre-trained baseline, with a particular focus on closing the performance gap between pass-at-one and pass-at-N metrics.\n\nThe primary data source for both training and evaluation is the **MATH dataset**, a benchmark comprising challenging, high-school-level competition math problems. For the SSFT phase, the models are fine-tuned on step-by-step solutions, with the authors noting that the **quality and style** of these solutions are critical parameters influencing final performance. For the SCR and multi-task phases, the methodology involves the generation of **candidate solution clusters**, likely produced via temperature sampling from the fine-tuned generator. These clusters are then used to create training data for the re-ranker/evaluator, which learns to identify and prioritize correct solution pathways. The study utilizes the **PaLM 2 family of models** (specifically the PaLM 2-L variant) as the base architecture, with fine-tuning configurations—such as the sequential separation of tasks in multi-task learning—being key experimental parameters.\n\nAnalysis is centered on the **accuracy** metric on the MATH test set, with a detailed examination of performance under different inference strategies. The core analytical technique involves comparing **pass-at-one** (greedy decoding) performance against **pass-at-N** (specifically pass@64 with temperature sampling) to quantify the latent potential of the models. The study empirically analyzes the isolated and synergistic effects of **majority voting** and solution re-ranking. Key findings are derived from ablations that vary the fine-tuning data quality, the use of sequential versus joint multi-task training, and the combination of re-ranking with majority voting. The ultimate outcome is a fine-tuning recipe that integrates these insights, achieving a reported **58.8% accuracy** on MATH, which constitutes an **11.2% absolute improvement** over the few-shot, pre-trained PaLM 2-L baseline using majority voting.",

However, during fine-tuning, MLLM often faces the risk of forgetting knowledge acquired during pre-training, which can result in a decline in generalization abilities.

      "methodology": "This study proposes a novel fine-tuning methodology for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and balance generalization with downstream specialization. The core research design is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach that selectively updates model parameters based on their estimated importance to both the pre-trained (upstream) and fine-tuning (downstream) distributions. The authors' approach is grounded in the empirical observation of a **Parameter Importance Difference (PID)**, quantified as the cosine distance between two vectors: the absolute values of the frozen pre-trained weights (\\(|w^*|\\)), representing upstream importance, and the absolute values of the accumulated fine-tuning gradients (\\(|g|\\)), representing downstream importance. They find that this PID is higher for unseen downstream distributions, motivating their intervention. To address this, they implement an **importance-aware weight allocation strategy**. This strategy identifies and selectively updates parameters that are relatively more important for the downstream task while being less critical for retaining pre-trained knowledge, thereby aiming to preserve the model's inherent generalization capabilities.\n\nFor empirical validation, the methodology employs a comprehensive experimental setup across established multimodal benchmarks. The primary downstream tasks are **image captioning**, evaluated on the **Flickr30k** and **NoCaps** datasets using metrics like CIDEr and SPICE, and **visual question answering (VQA)**, evaluated on the **OK-VQA** and **VQAv2** datasets using accuracy. The study tests its proposed fine-tuning technique on multiple MLLM architectures, including **LLaVA-1.5** and **InstructBLIP**, to demonstrate generalizability. Data collection for fine-tuning and evaluation relies entirely on these standard, publicly available datasets. The visual encoder is kept frozen throughout, following common practice, with fine-tuning focused on the connector and LLM modules.\n\nThe analysis techniques are both quantitative and comparative. The core metric for diagnosing the forgetting problem is the **PID** (\\(cos(|w^*|, |g|)^{-2}\\)). The effectiveness of the proposed fine-tuning method is assessed by comparing task-specific performance (specialization) against the retention of zero-shot generalization ability on out-of-distribution tasks. This involves a rigorous ablation study comparing the proposed importance-aware update strategy against standard full fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient methods like LoRA. Key configurations involve the strategy for ranking and selecting parameters for updates based on the derived importance scores. The methodology is framed as a resource allocation problem, where the \"budget\" is the number of parameters allowed to be updated, and the allocation is guided by the dual importance measures to optimize the specialization-generalization trade-off.",

      "methodology": "**Study Design and Approach**\nPromptIntern proposes a novel fine-tuning methodology designed to internalize recurrent prompt components—specifically instruction templates and few-shot examples—directly into the model's parameters, thereby eliminating their need during inference. The core approach is a structured fine-tuning pipeline comprising three sequential stages: instruction template compression, few-shot example absorption, and a progressive internalization strategy. First, the method compresses verbose, human-written instruction templates into concise, model-digestible formats. Second, it \"absorbs\" the informational content of few-shot examples into the model's weights through targeted training, rather than requiring their textual inclusion in the prompt. Finally, a progressive strategy is employed where the model is fine-tuned first with the full compressed prompt, then with gradually ablated versions (e.g., removing examples, then the template), forcing the internalization of knowledge. This design contrasts with prompt compression techniques that operate on a static, vanilla model; instead, PromptIntern actively modifies the model to operate effectively with minimal or no task-specific prompting.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources and Analysis Techniques**\nThe methodology is empirically validated on challenging Natural Language to Code (NL2Code) tasks. The primary datasets used for evaluation include **HumanEval** and **MBPP**, which are standard benchmarks for assessing code generation capabilities. The analysis employs quantitative metrics to measure three key outcomes: **inference efficiency**, **cost savings**, and **performance retention**. Efficiency is measured by the reduction in input tokens and the achieved inference speedup (e.g., 4.2x). Monetary cost reduction (e.g., 88.3%) is calculated based on token usage. Performance is evaluated using standard code generation metrics such as **pass@k** (likely pass@1) to ensure the internalization process does not degrade functional correctness compared to models using full prompts.\n\n**Key Parameters and Configurations**\nWhile the full experimental configuration is not detailed in the provided excerpt, key inferred parameters involve the fine-tuning regimen. The progressive internalization strategy defines a critical training schedule, sequentially reducing prompt content. The method leverages **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** techniques, such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), which is referenced in the introduction as a foundational approach. This implies the internalization is achieved without full model fine-tuning, aligning with efficient adaptation practices. The \"compression\" stage likely involves algorithmic or learned techniques to distill templates, and the \"absorption\" stage configures the training loss to prioritize learning from the provided examples, ensuring their knowledge is encoded into the model's adaptable parameters.",

This full-factorial design allows for the isolation and analysis of the individual and interactive effects of each instruction type on final model performance across the three target areas. The methodology is grounded in controlled comparison, using a consistent base model (e.g., LLaMA) and fine-tuning protocol across all mixture conditions to attribute performance differences directly to the composition of the training data.\n\nFor data collection, the authors curate a focused set of established public datasets to serve as archetypes for each instruction category. **P3** (the Public Pool of Prompts) is selected as the source for NLP task-oriented instructions, encompassing tasks like question answering and classification. **CodeAlpaca**, a derivative of the Alpaca dataset, is used exclusively for coding instructions. **Alpaca** itself, generated by self-instruct from a seed of OpenAI's `text-davinci-003`, serves as the source for diverse, general-purpose chat-like instructions. To characterize these datasets, the authors employ a **dependency parsing** technique on Alpaca's instructions to extract root verbs (e.g., *generate*, *create*), quantitatively demonstrating its semantic breadth compared to the more narrowly focused P3 and CodeAlpaca.\n\nThe analysis techniques are centered on multi-faceted evaluation using standardized benchmarks.

Our experiments show that differentially private adaptations of these approaches outperform previous private algorithms in three important dimensions: utility, privacy, and the computational and memory cost of private training. On many commonly studied datasets, the utility of private models approaches that of non-private models. For example, on the MNLI dataset we achieve an accuracy of $87.8\\%$ using RoBERTa-Large and $83.5\\%$ using RoBERTa-Base with a privacy budget of $ε= 6.7$.

      "methodology": "This study presents a methodological framework for differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), centered on a **parameter-efficient meta-framework**. The core design principle is to abstract recent non-private fine-tuning techniques into a unified approach where only a small subset of new parameters (*θ*) is trained under Differential Privacy Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD), while the vast majority of pre-trained weights (*W_PT*) remain frozen. This design is motivated by the hypothesis that confining updates to a low-dimensional manifold protects the pre-trained knowledge from the distortive effects of DP noise, which is particularly detrimental in low-data regimes. The approach is instantiated and empirically validated through three specific techniques: **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, **Adapter layers**, and **Compacters**. These are systematically compared against baseline methods of full model fine-tuning with DPSGD and the Rank-1 Gradient Perturbation (RGP) method, with evaluations focusing on utility-privacy trade-offs, computational efficiency, and memory footprint.\n\nThe analysis employs established natural language understanding benchmarks to assess performance. Primary datasets include **GLUE** (specifically SST-2 for sentiment analysis) and **SQuAD** for question answering, utilizing models such as **RoBERTa-Large** and **GPT-2**. The methodological evaluation is multi-faceted: utility is measured via standard **accuracy** (for classification) and **F1 score** (for SQuAD), while privacy is formally guaranteed by the **DPSGD algorithm** with carefully calibrated Gaussian noise. The privacy budget is expressed using the standard **(ε, δ)-DP** formulation. A key comparative analysis involves ablation studies on factors like the intrinsic dimension of the task and the size of the private dataset. Additionally, the methodology rigorously quantifies efficiency gains, reporting metrics like **memory consumption (GB)** and **wall-clock training time per epoch**, as demonstrated in comparisons showing DP-LoRA's significant reductions over full fine-tuning.\n\nKey configurations and parameters are central to the methodology's implementation. For **DP-LoRA**, the critical hyperparameter is the rank *r* (e.g., 4, 16, 64) of the low-rank matrices added to attention weights. For **Adapters** and **Compacters**, the bottleneck dimension *r* and the configuration parameters for the LPHM layer (e.g., *n* and *k*) define the parameter efficiency. Across all experiments, core DPSGD parameters—including **clipping norm (C)**, **noise multiplier (σ)**, **learning rate**, and **batch size**—are tuned to navigate the privacy-utility trade-off. The number of trainable parameters as a percentage of the total model (ranging from 0.05% to 1%) is a reported metric that underscores the parameter efficiency. This structured configuration allows the study to isolate the impact of the fine-tuning method itself from other variables, providing clear evidence that parameter-efficient reparameterizations offer superior utility under DP constraints while delivering substantial gains in storage and computational efficiency.",

The core research design challenges the prevailing paradigm in agent-tuning, which exclusively utilizes successful interaction trajectories (positive examples) for fine-tuning smaller models. The authors propose that unsuccessful trajectories (negative examples) contain valuable, learnable signals. Their approach involves a simple yet strategic modification to the fine-tuning data: appending a prefix or suffix to each trajectory that explicitly labels it as either a successful or failed example. This design allows the model to learn not only the correct patterns from positive trajectories but also to distinguish and avoid the erroneous reasoning or action sequences present in negative ones, thereby making more efficient use of collected interaction data.\n\nFor data collection, the methodology follows a common agent-tuning pipeline but expands the usable dataset. The researchers use a powerful, closed-source LLM (e.g., GPT-4) as a \"teacher\" to interact with task-specific environments, generating interaction trajectories that include the model's actions (e.g., tool calls) and environmental observations. Crucially, unlike prior work that discards trajectories failing to complete the task, this study retains both successful and unsuccessful trajectories. The specific datasets used for evaluation span multiple reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-hop question answering (HotpotQA), and strategic question answering (StrategyQA). These datasets provide the environments and tasks for trajectory generation, ensuring the method is tested on complex, tool-requiring problems.\n\nThe analysis techniques are primarily quantitative, centered on comparing the performance of models fine-tuned with and without negative examples. Key evaluation metrics include task-specific accuracy (e.g., answer correctness on GSM8K and HotpotQA) to measure overall agent capability. Furthermore, the authors conduct a qualitative analysis of inference results to examine how the integration of negative examples alters the model's behavior, specifically investigating the trade-off between leveraging valuable information and propagating errors from failed trajectories. While not exhaustively detailed in the provided text, key configurations would involve the choice of base model for fine-tuning (a smaller, open-source LLM), the specific formatting of the success/failure prefix/suffix, and the mixture ratio of positive to negative examples in the training set. The study demonstrates that this simple integration strategy yields significant performance improvements, establishing the empirical value of negative trajectories in agent development.",

      "methodology": "### Analysis of Research Methodology in WizardLM\n\nThe study employs a novel, iterative methodology centered on **Evol-Instruct**, a technique designed to automatically generate complex instruction-following data. The core design is a **synthetic data generation and fine-tuning approach**. Starting with an initial seed of simple human-written instructions (e.g., from the Alpaca dataset), the authors use a large language model (LLM) to apply a series of evolutionary operations—such as deepening, concretizing, and increasing reasoning steps—to rewrite each instruction into progressively more complex variants. This creates a multi-generational corpus of instructions with escalating difficulty. The final model, **WizardLM**, is then produced by fine-tuning the LLaMA foundation model on a mixture of this evolved data, thereby teaching it to follow complex instructions without direct human creation of such challenging examples.\n\nFor data collection, the methodology leverages **existing datasets as a seed** and **LLM-powered synthesis** for expansion. The primary seed is the 52K instruction dataset from **Alpaca** (derived from Self-Instruct), which consists of relatively simple instructions. Using Evol-Instruct, the authors generate multiple complex versions for each seed instruction, resulting in a large-scale, open-domain instruction dataset with a controlled difficulty gradient. This approach explicitly addresses the limitations of human-created datasets noted in the paper, such as the cost of annotation and the skew toward easy-to-moderate complexity observed in datasets like **ShareGPT**. The final training corpus is a blend of the original and evolved instructions.\n\nThe analysis combines **automatic metrics** and **human evaluation** to assess model performance. Automatically, the authors employ **GPT-4 as a judge** to compare the outputs of WizardLM against baseline models (Alpaca and Vicuna) across a diverse test set, a technique aligning with contemporary LLM evaluation practices. Human evaluators are also used to provide direct pairwise comparisons between models based on criteria like correctness, depth, and comprehensiveness. Key configurations include the use of the **LLaMA** model family as the base for fine-tuning and the strategic application of **evolutionary prompts** within Evol-Instruct to govern the complexity transformations. The central metric of success is the model’s ability to outperform baselines on **complex instruction-following tasks**, as validated by both automated and human assessments, demonstrating the efficacy of the evolved training data.",

      "methodology": "**Study Design and Approach**\n\nThis research employs an experimental methodology to investigate whether very high dropout rates during fine-tuning can induce \"rich representations\" that enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, as an alternative to more computationally expensive ensemble techniques. The core approach is a comparative intervention study, where a large pre-trained model is fine-tuned under different regularization conditions. The authors hypothesize that while training from scratch with extreme dropout is infeasible, fine-tuning a robust pre-trained model under such conditions is viable and can prevent the collapse into sparse, in-distribution-optimal features driven by the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent. The design directly contrasts the proposed method—very-large dropout fine-tuning—against established baselines, including standard fine-tuning, model soups (weight averaging), and explicit ensembles, across a suite of distribution shift benchmarks.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\n\nThe study utilizes established, publicly available datasets and benchmarks to ensure reproducibility and facilitate comparison. Pre-training leverages large-scale foundational datasets, implicitly referencing models like those from the CLIP family. For fine-tuning and evaluation, the methodology employs specialized benchmarks designed to measure OOD robustness. Specifically, the paper references distribution shift benchmarks such as ImageNet variants (e.g., ImageNet-V2, ImageNet-Sketch, ImageNet-A) and WILDS, which are standard for assessing generalization under covariate shift. These datasets provide the controlled multiple distributions necessary to test the hypothesis that rich representations confer benefits beyond the primary training distribution.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\n\nThe primary analysis technique is empirical evaluation using accuracy metrics on the aforementioned OOD test sets. The key intervention is the application of \"very-large\" dropout rates—substantially higher than the conventional range of 0.1-0.5—applied to the final layers of the network during fine-tuning. A critical configuration parameter is the dropout probability, which is systematically varied to demonstrate its effect. The performance of the high-dropout fine-tuned model is quantitatively compared to the baselines using these OOD accuracy scores. The analysis implicitly involves examining the learned representations, arguing that high dropout forces the model to maintain and utilize a broader set of features (both strongly and weakly relevant) by preventing any single sub-network from becoming overly specialized to the fine-tuning data, thereby promoting linearity and feature richness in the parameter space.\n\n**Key Parameters or Configurations**\n\nThe central experimental parameter is the **dropout rate**, pushed to unusually high values (e.g., 0.9 or above). The **model architecture** is a large pre-trained vision model, such as a Vision Transformer (ViT) or similar, whose parameters are initialized from a strong pre-trained checkpoint. The **fine-tuning dataset** is a comparatively smaller, task-specific set. The **optimization procedure** during fine-tuning, including learning rate and batch size, is configured to stabilize training under the severe regularization of extreme dropout. The **evaluation metrics** are classification accuracy across a curated set of OOD test distributions, with the comparison focused on the performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution results.",

This design allows for a direct comparison of performance gains in ideal settings versus degradation in non-ideal ones, thereby testing the hypothesis that current RL fine-tuning fails to cultivate robust, advanced reasoning analogous to human cognition.\n\nFor data collection and sources, the methodology leverages eight established public datasets to construct the evaluation suite.

The core methodological approach is twofold. First, the authors perform a **conceptual unification**, re-framing diverse methods—including adapter tuning, prefix tuning, and LoRA—as modular modifications to specific hidden states within a frozen pre-trained language model (PLM). They define a set of **design dimensions** (e.g., the function to compute the modification, the position in the network architecture where it is applied) to systematically categorize and contrast these techniques. Second, they conduct a **large-scale empirical investigation** to validate their framework, identify critical design choices, and synthesize new method instantiations. The study is designed as a **controlled comparative analysis**, where various PETL methods are evaluated under consistent conditions across multiple NLP tasks to isolate the impact of their architectural differences.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\nThe empirical evaluation leverages a comprehensive suite of **standard public benchmarks** spanning four major NLP task categories. Specifically, the authors use: (1) **Machine Translation**: the IWSLT14 German-to-English (De-En) and English-to-German (En-De) datasets; (2) **Text Summarization**: the XSum dataset; (3) **Language Understanding**: the GLUE benchmark; and (4) **Text Classification**: the E2E NLG Challenge, WebNLG, and DART datasets. These datasets are well-established in the literature, ensuring reproducibility and facilitating direct comparison with prior work. The pre-trained models used as backbones are also standard, primarily variants of the **Transformer architecture**, allowing the research to focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of the tuning methods rather than model-scale differences.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\nThe primary analysis technique is **quantitative performance comparison** using standard task-specific metrics: BLEU for translation, ROUGE for summarization, accuracy (and Matthew’s correlation for CoLA) for GLUE, and BLEU/NIST for text generation tasks. The experiments are meticulously configured to ensure a fair comparison: all methods fine-tune only a small subset of parameters (e.g., often <0.1% of the PLM's parameters) while keeping the original model weights frozen. Key parameters and configurations under scrutiny include the **insertion form** (e.g., additive vs. concatenative modifications), **modification function** (e.g., MLP vs. attention), **integration style** (serial vs. parallel), and **composition function**. The unified framework enables an **ablation study** across these design dimensions. Furthermore, the authors perform a **transfer of design elements** across methods, synthesizing new PETL configurations (e.g., combining aspects of prefix tuning and adapters) to empirically demonstrate the utility of their unifying perspective.

      "methodology": "**Study Design and Approach**\n\nThe study employs a **novel framework design** to address the under-exploration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for 3D point cloud models. The core methodological approach is the introduction of **Point-PEFT**, a two-component PEFT architecture that is integrated into frozen, pre-trained 3D transformer backbones. The design is predicated on the principle of freezing the vast majority of a model's pre-trained parameters and optimizing only the newly inserted, lightweight modules during downstream adaptation. The two specialized components are the **Point-prior Prompt** and the **Geometry-aware Adapter**. The Point-prior Prompt utilizes a set of learnable tokens, enhanced by a memory bank of domain-specific knowledge and a parameter-free attention mechanism, to guide the model on downstream tasks. The Geometry-aware Adapter is engineered to explicitly capture the fine-grained, local geometric structures inherent in point clouds by aggregating features within spatial neighborhoods, addressing the irregular and sparse nature of 3D data. This modular approach allows the framework to be generically applied to various existing 3D pre-trained models, as demonstrated with Point-BERT, Point-MAE, and Point-M2AE.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\n\nThe methodology is validated using established, publicly available benchmark datasets for 3D point cloud understanding. For the primary evaluation of **object classification**, the widely used **ModelNet40** dataset is employed, which contains 12,311 CAD models from 40 object categories. For the task of **few-shot classification**, experiments are conducted on the **ScanObjectNN** dataset, a more challenging real-world dataset with 2,902 objects in 15 categories, featuring background clutter and occlusions. To assess performance on **part segmentation**, the **ShapeNetPart** dataset is utilized, comprising 16,881 shapes from 16 categories, annotated with 50 part labels. The use of these standard datasets ensures the comparability of results and demonstrates the framework's efficacy across different data domains (synthetic vs. real-world) and task complexities (object-level vs. part-level).\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\n\nThe analysis is primarily quantitative, benchmarking Point-PEFT against **full fine-tuning** and other PEFT baselines (e.g., Visual Prompt Tuning, AdaptFormer) using standard performance metrics. For classification tasks, the standard **overall accuracy (OA)** is reported. For part segmentation, the standard **mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)** across all part categories and the **instance-wise average accuracy** are used. A critical analytical focus is on **parameter efficiency**, with the paper meticulously reporting the percentage and absolute count of trainable parameters. The key configuration achieving the headline result involves tuning **only 5% of the trainable parameters** compared to full fine-tuning. The experimental design systematically ablates the contributions of each component (Point-prior Prompt and Geometry-aware Adapter) and evaluates the framework's robustness across multiple pre-trained model architectures and downstream tasks, thereby isolating and verifying the effectiveness of the proposed methodological innovations.",

The methodology is fundamentally deductive: it begins with a comprehensive mathematical dissection of adapter-based, prompt-based, and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) techniques from a **decomposition perspective**, aiming to uncover their underlying operational principles and explain performance disparities.

To address this, the authors introduce a **partial transfer strategy**, which selectively freezes or fine-tunes specific layers of a pre-trained model. The approach is further refined by applying **layer-wise adaptive learning rates** to control the extent of knowledge preservation during fine-tuning on the novel, few-shot support set.

The primary analysis technique is a **systematic performance comparison** against state-of-the-art methods, using the standard metric of **few-shot classification accuracy** (e.g., 1-shot and 5-shot, 5-way accuracy).

The core approach is tool-building rather than a singular empirical study; the paper introduces a standardized experimentation platform that enables comparative research on learning from diverse feedback modalities. The system is designed to generalize across environments and user populations, allowing researchers to isolate and manipulate variables such as feedback type, task complexity, and human factors. This modular design supports within-subjects or between-subjects experimental designs where the independent variables are the configurations of the feedback interface (e.g., demonstrations vs. rankings) and the dependent variables are derived from both human interaction data (e.g., time, consistency) and agent learning outcomes (e.g., reward model accuracy, policy performance). The overarching goal is to move beyond simplified theoretical assumptions about feedback quality by grounding RLHF research in controlled, reproducible human-subject experiments.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**\n\nThe primary data collection is envisioned to be human-generated feedback, harvested directly through the interactive interface of RLHF-Blender during user studies. The system is engineered to collect a diverse array of feedback types, which are explicitly listed as demonstrations (e.g., trajectory data), rankings, pairwise comparisons, and natural language instructions. The framework does not prescribe a specific task dataset but is built to be compatible with various environments, implying that the source data is task-agnostic and generated *in situ* by study participants. Crucially, the platform also facilitates the collection of metadata related to human factors, such as the time taken to provide feedback, perceived difficulty, and user-specific traits. This enables the creation of rich, multi-modal datasets that pair raw feedback signals with contextual metadata about the feedback provision process, allowing for analyses that correlate interaction characteristics with learning efficacy.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**\n\nThe proposed analysis techniques are twofold, targeting both human behavioral data and machine learning performance. For human data, the system enables quantification of feedback characteristics like irrationality (e.g., violation of transitive preferences in rankings), bias, and consistency, which can be analyzed using standard statistical methods. For reward learning, the collected feedback serves as training data for reward models, with subsequent evaluation of the trained agents' policies in the target environment. Key performance metrics would thus include reward model accuracy (e.g., correlation with a ground-truth reward if available) and downstream policy success rates. The principal configurations of the RLHF-Blender system, which constitute the main independent variables for any study using it, include: 1) the **feedback type** (demonstration, ranking, comparison, language), 2) the **interface and interaction design** for collecting each feedback type, 3) the **task or environment** in which the agent operates, and 4) parameters governing **feedback aggregation and active query selection**. This configurability allows researchers to systematically investigate the interplay between feedback modality, human factors, and reward learning efficiency.",

This approach contrasts with traditional single-stage tuning, aiming to enhance model robustness by first building broad task comprehension before aligning outputs with human-preferred formats. The framework is built upon established VLM architectures (e.g., LLaVA), integrating a bridging module (MLP layers) to connect pre-trained image encoders (e.g., CLIP-ViT) and large language models (LLMs).\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**  \nThe authors construct the **Vision-Flan dataset**, comprising **1,664,261 instances** across **187 distinct visual tasks** sourced from **academic datasets** (e.g., computer vision benchmarks). Each task is paired with an **expert-written instruction** to ensure quality and diversity, covering areas such as visual question answering, optical character recognition (OCR), and object detection. This human-labeled dataset is intended to address the lack of task variety in prior pre-training data (e.g., image captioning-dominated corpora like LAION). For the second tuning stage, the authors use **GPT-4 synthesized data** generated from existing visual dataset annotations, though they critically note its limitations in quality and bias. The study emphasizes scaling human-labeled tasks rather than relying solely on synthetic data, aiming to reduce hallucination and catastrophic forgetting.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Parameters**  \nThe evaluation employs **multi-modal benchmarks** to assess model performance across diverse capabilities, including generalizability, hallucination, and task-specific accuracy. The authors conduct **in-depth ablation studies** to isolate the effects of each tuning stage, revealing that GPT-4 data primarily modulates response style rather than enhancing core capabilities. Key parameters include the **volume of GPT-4 data** (e.g., as few as 1,000 instances suffice for alignment) and the **composition of the Vision-Flan dataset** (task diversity and instance count). Metrics likely encompass standard VLM benchmarks (e.g., VQA accuracy, OCR F1 scores), though specific benchmarks are not detailed in the excerpt. The analysis also explores the role of visual instruction tuning in improving LLMs’ understanding of visual features, using comparative experiments between single-stage and two-stage frameworks.\n\n**Overall Methodology Summary**  \nThis research methodology combines **large-scale, human-annotated dataset creation** with a **structured two-stage training regimen** to enhance VLM performance. By prioritizing task diversity through curated data and decoupling skill acquisition from stylistic alignment, the approach aims to produce more generalizable and reliable models. The critical analysis of GPT-4 synthesized data further underscores the importance of human oversight in instruction tuning, offering a replicable framework for future VLM development.",

We propose ARLBench, a benchmark for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in RL that allows comparisons of diverse HPO approaches while being highly efficient in evaluation. To enable research into HPO in RL, even in settings with low compute resources, we select a representative subset of HPO tasks spanning a variety of algorithm and environment combinations.

      "methodology": "**Study Design and Approach**  \nThe core methodological contribution of ARLBench is the design of a benchmarking framework for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in reinforcement learning (RL) that prioritizes computational efficiency and representativeness. The authors address the prohibitive cost of evaluating AutoRL methods by constructing a curated subset of HPO tasks, each defined by a specific RL algorithm and environment combination. This subset is not arbitrary; it is derived from an extensive prior dataset of hyperparameter landscapes, enabling the selection of tasks that are maximally informative about performance across the broader space of possible tasks. The benchmark is implemented using JAX-based RL libraries, which provide significant computational speedups over established frameworks like StableBaselines3 (SB3). The study design is comparative and evaluative, measuring both the runtime efficiency of the benchmark itself and its ability to produce performance profiles of HPO methods that generalize to a larger set of environments.\n\n**Data Collection Methods and Sources**  \nThe foundational data for task selection comes from a pre-existing, large-scale dataset of hyperparameter landscapes for RL, which the authors leverage to ensure the statistical validity of their subset. This dataset contains performance evaluations (e.g., final episodic return) across numerous hyperparameter configurations for various algorithm-environment pairs. From this corpus, the authors apply a selection strategy to identify a minimal yet representative subset of tasks. The benchmark then provides these tasks as standardized evaluation units, where each task’s performance landscape is pre-characterized. This approach transforms data collection from a costly online training process into an efficient lookup and simulation based on prior empirical results, drastically reducing the computational burden for new HPO method evaluations.\n\n**Analysis Techniques and Key Configurations**  \nThe primary analysis technique is a runtime and representativeness evaluation. Runtime efficiency is quantified by comparing the total wall-clock time required to execute a fixed HPO procedure (32 configurations with 10 seeds each) on both the full environment set and the curated subset, using both ARLBench (JAX-based) and SB3 implementations. The key metric is the speedup factor, reported as up to 11.61× faster when comparing ARLBench on the subset to SB3 on the full set. Representativeness is implicitly validated by the subset’s derivation from the comprehensive landscape dataset, ensuring that performance rankings of HPO methods on the subset correlate with those on the full set. Key configurations benchmarked include prominent RL algorithms—Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)—across a diverse range of environments from categories such as classic control, locomotion, and Atari games, though specific environment names are not detailed in the excerpt.

The authors conduct a **critical literature review** and **theoretical argumentation** grounded in social epistemology and pluralist philosophy of science to interrogate the foundational assumptions and practices of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The study design is explicitly normative and prescriptive, aiming to identify epistemic and ethical shortcomings in current RLHF implementations and to propose a structured agenda for reform. The approach is interdisciplinary, synthesizing insights from AI technical literature, philosophy of science, and ethics to build a coherent argument for increased pluralism in the feedback processes used to align Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nThe \"data\" for this analysis consists entirely of **existing scholarly literature and documented technical procedures**. The authors draw upon two key types of sources: 1) **Technical AI research papers** that detail RLHF methodologies, such as Ziegler et al. (2020) on language models and Henry et al. (2010) on robotics, which serve as exemplars of the standard RLHF pipeline. 2) **Theoretical works from philosophy and social science** that provide the conceptual framework for analyzing diversity, values, and epistemic justification. No new datasets, surveys, or experiments are collected or conducted; the analysis is built upon a synthesis of these published texts to examine the implied sociotechnical configurations of RLHF systems.\n\nThe core **analysis technique** is **philosophical critique and conceptual elaboration**. The authors analyze the standard RLHF pipeline—foundational pre-training, task-specific fine-tuning, and iterative refinement via human feedback—to identify a critical juncture: the composition of the human feedback group. They then apply conceptual tools from social epistemology, such as the **epistemic advantages of diverse perspectives** and the **risks of homogeneity**, to this technical process. The analysis proceeds by logically extrapolating the consequences of homogeneous versus heterogeneous feedback pools on model outputs, arguing that robustness emerges from the interplay of distinct stances. The key **parameters or configurations** under scrutiny are not algorithmic hyperparameters but **sociotechnical variables**: the cultural, social, and political backgrounds of human labelers; the range of values and perspectives encoded in the reward model; and the institutional structures governing feedback collection. The primary \"metric\" of evaluation is normative, concerning the **broad acceptability, applicability, and insightfulness** of LLM outputs, which the authors argue is contingent on these pluralist configurations.

As the scale of foundational models grows exponentially, the computational cost and methodological complexity of adapting them to downstream tasks have spurred a vibrant field of research. This review synthesizes recent literature to address the central question: **How can we effectively and efficiently adapt large language models to specific tasks and domains while preserving their general capabilities?** The surveyed work reveals a shift from simple full-parameter updates towards sophisticated strategies that are parameter-efficient, data-aware, and stability-preserving. This narrative will explore these developments thematically, analyzing innovations in memory-efficient tuning, techniques to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, data-centric training strategies, domain-specialization pipelines, and the empirical diagnostics that underpin them. It will conclude by critiquing methodological trends and outlining pivotal research gaps that must be addressed to advance the field from a collection of empirical successes to a more principled engineering and scientific discipline.\n\n### **Thematic Analysis**\n\n**Memory and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) Innovations**\nA dominant theme in contemporary research is the development of PEFT methods that drastically reduce memory and computational overhead without sacrificing performance. While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) established a popular baseline by updating low-rank matrices injected into model layers, recent innovations challenge the assumption of uniform update importance across parameters. A key diagnostic insight driving new methods is the observation of skewed update distributions. For instance, [LISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning, 2024] found that during LoRA fine-tuning, weight update norms are consistently concentrated in the bottom and/or top layers of transformer models. This empirical finding motivated LISA’s approach of importance sampling, where most middle layers are randomly frozen during optimization. This simple strategy achieves memory costs comparable to LoRA while reportedly outperforming it on benchmarks like MT-Bench, suggesting that not all layers require simultaneous updating for effective adaptation.\n\nThis principle of selective updating extends beyond layers to individual parameters. In the multimodal context, [Learn from Downstream and Be Yourself in Multimodal Large Language Model Fine-Tuning, 2024] introduces the Parameter Importance Discrepancy (PID) framework, which measures the conflict between a parameter’s importance for upstream (pre-trained) knowledge versus downstream task performance. Their proposed SPIDER method selectively updates parameters by consolidating those with high importance for generalization (measured via pre-trained weight magnitude) and optimizing those important for specialization (measured via accumulated gradient norms). Both LISA and SPIDER exemplify a next generation of PEFT that moves beyond uniform low-rank updates towards more intelligent, empirically-grounded update allocation. The area of agreement here is that the over-parameterized nature of LLMs allows for sparse or selective updates without performance loss, and that identifying the *right* parameters to update is more valuable than simply reducing the update count. A point of contrast lies in the granularity: LISA operates at the layer level, which is coarse but extremely simple, while SPIDER operates at the parameter level, offering finer control but requiring more complex importance metrics.\n\n**Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting and Balancing Generalization**\nClosely related to PEFT is the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where adapting a model to a new task degrades its performance on original capabilities. This stability-plasticity dilemma has become a central focus, particularly for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) where aligning visual and textual representations can severely disrupt linguistic knowledge. The literature converges on the view that forgetting is not an inevitable byproduct of fine-tuning but a manageable consequence of parameter interference. The PID concept from [SPIDER, 2024] provides a measurable mechanism for this interference, showing a higher discrepancy for unseen downstream distributions. The proposed solution—partitioning parameters into those to be consolidated for general knowledge and those to be adapted for new tasks—directly addresses this interference.\n\nThis theme highlights a critical area of agreement: successful fine-tuning must explicitly balance specialization and generalization. Methods that update all parameters (full fine-tuning) or even a fixed, task-agnostic subset (like standard LoRA adapters) risk excessive interference. The emerging paradigm, as seen in SPIDER, is to make this trade-off explicit and data-driven. The literature suggests that the goal is not merely to remember old tasks but to preserve the core representational and reasoning structures acquired during pre-training. While the discussed papers primarily address this in a two-distribution (upstream vs. one downstream) setting, they lay the groundwork for more complex continual learning scenarios. The emphasis on measuring and mitigating forgetting represents a significant maturation from viewing fine-tuning as a simple task-specific optimization to treating it as a constrained adaptation problem that must respect the model’s foundational knowledge.\n\n**Data-Centric and Sequential Training Strategies**\nBeyond *how* to update parameters, a significant body of research investigates *what* data and training sequence lead to superior fine-tuned models. This theme underscores that performance is profoundly influenced by the quality, format, and orchestration of the fine-tuning process itself. [Improving Large Language Model Fine-tuning for Solving Math Problems, 2023] provides a compelling case study, demonstrating that the quality and step-by-step formatting of mathematical solutions in the fine-tuning data have a large impact on final performance. This finding elevates the importance of data curation over mere data scaling for specialized domains.\n\nFurthermore, this work illustrates the power of sequential and multi-task training strategies. Their multi-task sequential fine-tuning, where a model is trained first as a solution generator, then as an evaluator, and finally as a generator again, yields gains over single-stage supervised fine-tuning. This indicates that auxiliary tasks (like binary evaluation) can provide complementary learning signals that refine the model’s primary generative capability. The synergy between fine-tuning and inference-time techniques is another key insight; combining solution-cluster re-ranking with majority voting was found to be more effective and efficient than either alone. These approaches coalesce into complex, holistic “recipes” that treat fine-tuning not as a one-off step but as a multi-faceted pipeline involving data engineering, staged training, and enhanced decoding. The contrast here is with simpler, one-shot fine-tuning approaches, and the literature suggests that for challenging domains like mathematical reasoning, such sophisticated recipes are necessary to achieve state-of-the-art results.\n\n**Domain Specialization and Real-World Application Pipelines**\nA practical driver of fine-tuning research is the need to equip LLMs with deep, reliable expertise for professional domains. This theme focuses on building end-to-end pipelines that transition from general models to trustworthy domain-specific tools. [Automating Research Synthesis with Domain-Specific Large Language Model Fine-Tuning, 2024] exemplifies this, fine-tuning models on corpora extracted from academic papers to automate systematic literature review synthesis. Its significance lies not only in demonstrating successful domain adaptation but in directly confronting the primary barriers to real-world deployment: hallucination and lack of verifiability. The proposed integration of source attribution mechanisms directly addresses the scholarly requirement for auditability.\n\nThis application-oriented research highlights a shift in evaluation criteria from benchmark scores to real-world utility and reliability. Validation through the replication of an existing human-conducted PRISMA review provides a tangible, rigorous test of factual accuracy and synthesis capability. A notable broader implication from this work is the call to update human-centric methodological standards (e.g., PRISMA) to govern AI-assisted processes, emphasizing transparency. This theme reveals an area of growing consensus: for high-stakes domains, effective fine-tuning must be part of a larger system that includes guardrails, verification mechanisms, and interpretability tools. The focus expands from optimizing a model’s output to engineering a credible and dependable workflow.\n\n**Empirical Analysis and Diagnosis of Fine-Tuning Dynamics**\nUnderpinning the methodological advances in the previous themes is a foundation of empirical analysis. Many innovative papers begin with diagnostic studies to uncover the mechanistic behaviors of fine-tuning. The discovery of skewed layer-wise updates in [LISA, 2024] and the quantification of Parameter Importance Discrepancy in [SPIDER, 2024] are prime examples of how empirical observation drives innovation. This theme encompasses research dedicated to understanding *how* and *why* fine-tuning succeeds or fails, providing the evidence base for new algorithms.\n\nA consistent pattern across the literature, however, is a noted gap between strong empirical results and deep theoretical understanding. Multiple papers, including those on LISA and sequential math training, conclude with calls for better mechanistic explanations. Why do middle layers tolerate random freezing? What is the causal relationship between evaluation-task training and improved generation? The current body of work is rich in correlational findings but poorer in causal, theoretical models. This diagnostic theme is also characterized by a methodological strength—comprehensive evaluation across model scales (7B to 70B) and diverse benchmarks—and a corresponding limitation: findings are often tied to specific model families (LLaMA, PaLM) or task types, raising questions about generalizability across architectures like encoder-decoder models or other fine-tuning paradigms like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\n\n### **Critical Discussion**\n\nThe literature reveals a clear trajectory from monolithic fine-tuning towards modular, intelligent, and constrained adaptation. The prevailing trend is the rejection of the “one-size-fits-all” update in favor of methods that are selective (LISA, SPIDER), sequential [Improving Large Language Model Fine-tuning for Solving Math Problems, 2023], and system-aware [Automating Research Synthesis with Domain-Specific Large Language Model Fine-Tuning, 2024]. A strong pattern is the reliance on empirical diagnostics to identify inefficiencies (like uniform updates) or problems (like PID) and then to engineer targeted solutions. This has proven highly fruitful, yielding methods that often outperform strong baselines like LoRA.\n\nMethodologically, the field heavily favors empirical, benchmark-driven research. While this has accelerated progress, it introduces considerations. First, the reliance on aggregate benchmark scores (MMLU, MT-Bench) may obscure nuanced failures or capabilities, particularly for interactive or reasoning tasks. Second, the complexity of new “recipes” can threaten reproducibility and obscure which components are truly necessary, as ablated cost-effectiveness analyses are often lacking. Third, there is a noticeable concentration on certain model architectures (decoder-only transformers) and fine-tuning scenarios (instruction-tuning), leaving other important paradigms relatively underexplored. A critical limitation across many studies is the treatment of hyperparameters for new methods; without thorough sensitivity analyses, optimal results may appear as fortuitous configurations rather than robust evidence of a method’s superiority.\n\n### **Gaps and Future Directions**\n\nThe reviewed literature points to several critical research gaps. First is the **lack of theoretical foundations** for many empirical successes. Future work must develop stronger theoretical models to explain phenomena like layer-wise importance skew and the efficacy of sequential training, moving the field from heuristic innovation to principled design. Second, the **scope of fine-tuning paradigms is narrow**. Research must expand beyond instruction-tuning to rigorously explore dynamics in continued pre-training, RLHF, preference optimization, and for diverse architectures (encoder-decoder, multimodal beyond vision-language). Third, there is **insufficient investigation into hyperparameter sensitivity and optimization** for new methods, requiring standardized ablation studies and perhaps meta-learning approaches for hyperparameter configuration. Fourth, research often neglects **complex, real-world deployment constraints** such as continual/multi-task learning, streaming data adaptation, and robustness to adversarial inputs or distribution shifts post-deployment. Finally, evaluation must evolve to assess **higher-order cognitive capabilities** like calibration, uncertainty estimation, reasoning faithfulness, and long-form interactive collaboration, which are crucial for trustworthy application.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThis review synthesizes a rapidly evolving field centered on the efficient and effective adaptation of large language models. The collective findings underscore that modern fine-tuning is a multifaceted challenge requiring solutions that are parameter-efficient, stability-preserving, data-aware, and integrated into reliable application pipelines. Key insights include the non-uniform importance of parameters, the necessity of explicitly balancing specialization with generalization, and the profound impact of data quality and training orchestration. While the empirical richness of current research has yielded significant performance gains, the path forward demands a deeper theoretical understanding, broader exploration of fine-tuning scenarios, and more rigorous evaluation under realistic constraints. Addressing these challenges will be essential to transition LLM fine-tuning from a specialized engineering practice into a robust and generalizable cornerstone of reliable AI system development.",
